\section{Aircraft noise and human response}
At the beginning of the 20th century the first practical aircraft were developed
and since then developments in aviation went fast.
As aircraft became more common, more flights took place and more airports were
constructed. An increasing amount of people lives in the vicinity of airports
and are exposed to aircraft noise.

Aircraft noise can cause annoyance and sleep disturbance. Currently, annoyance 
and sleep disturbance are predicted using indicators based on time-averaged sound pressure 
levels. To obtain a more complete representation of annoyance one should 
predict the audible aircraft sound and determine the impact of the sound on people.

\subsection{Noise prediction}



\subsubsection{Prediction models}


Noise-Power-Distance-tables, or NPD-tables, are the backbone of a wide range of aircraft noise models in use, like the Integrated Noise Model (INM) \cite{Arntzen2011}.

At Empa the noise prediction model FLULA is used, and a new model called sonAIR is in development \cite{sonAIR}.

% The urban environment contains many different kinds of sounds, coming from sources ranging from cars to cats, ... to the music someone is listening to in his or her living room whilst a window is open.

% TODO: taken from overview paper
% Auralisation is a technique to simulate the audible sound of an object or environment.
Auralisation is a method to render audible virtual sound fields \cite{Kleiner1993}.
The method has been used to simulate the audible sound inside
rooms, but also for the sound of
cars \cite{Forssen2009,Maillard2012,Pieren2015,Hoffmann2016,Hoffmann2016a},
trains \cite{Pieren2016},
windturbines \cite{Pieren2014,Heutschi2014},
fans \cite{Merino2016} and
aircraft \cite{Arntzen2014a, Rizzi2016a, Rizzi2016}. Auralisation of outdoor sources
and environments is a key topic of the VASTCON Technical Working Group \cite{Vastcon}.

% Common reasons for generating auralisations is to determine how new and old spaces sound,

Different auralisation methods exist. Often emission synthesis and sound
propagation are separated. This is not always the case because its not always
possible, like e.g. when using a wave-based method
\cite{Hornikx2016,Georgiou2016,Georgiou2016a}.

Common methods for the emission synthesis are spectral modelling synthesis (SMS)
and granular synthesis. Granular synthesis typically uses grains based on
measurements and is a computationally fast method for synthesis. Spectral
modelling synthesis generates a signal through a superposition of two types of
signal components: tones and noise. Whereas with the granular synthesis method
each grain typically corresponds directly to specific conditions, e.g. the speed
of and distance to the source, with spectral modelling synthesis the synthesis
strategy can be considered separate from the underlying model, and therefore a
emission synthesis model can be established that relates tonal and spectral
components to the operational state of the source.



\subsection{Aircraft noise auralisation}

% TODO: taken from overview paper
Aircraft auralisation has been used to study future aircraft types
\cite{Rizzi2013,Rizzi2016,Rizzi2016a} and flight procedures \cite{Sahai2016} but
also to investigate the perceived unpleasantness of aircraft flyover noise as
function of certain temporal parameters \cite{Pate2017}.

Aspects to consider when simulating the sound of aircraft are the different
noise sources on the aircraft, the state of the aircraft and thereby the state
of these sources, as well as the condition of the environment.
% \subsection{Aircraft emission}
The main noise sources of a turbojet aircraft are jet noise, fan and turbine
noise, combustion noise and airframe noise. In the case of turboprop aircraft
the main source is the propellor\cite{Zaporozhets2011}. Fan or propellor noise
is mostly tonal whereas the other sources are broadband noise.
Which exact sources are most relevant depends on the aircraft type and flight
procedure as well as the position of the source with respect to the receiver due
to directivity of the sources \cite{Bertsch2015}.

The aircraft emission prediction tools found in the ANOPP-Source Functional
Module of ANOPP2 \cite{Lopes2016, Tuttle2017} and INSTANT\cite{Sahai2016b}, which is based
on ANOPP, use established models for the noise prediction of the individual
noise sources. The Heidmann model is for example used for fan noise and the
Stone model for jet noise. The Heidmann model in ANOPP models
five sources explicitly, of which three correspond to emission of tones and two
to emission of broadband noise \cite{Arntzen2014a}. The model outputs for each
of these five sources a spectrum in fractional-octaves.
For broadband synthesis in the NAF\cite{Aumann2015}, power of the tonal
components in each band is divided by the amount of tones in that band.
Nowadays the Heidmann model in ANOPP can output the frequencies and amplitudes
of forward and aft radiated fan tones. Only Buzz-Saw noise is still output in
\nicefrac{1}{3}-octaves.

\section{Thesis aim}

\subsection{Aim}

The aim of the thesis is to develop a tool to simulate the audible sound of
aircraft in an urban environment, so that new methodologies can be developed to
assess annoyance and sleep disturbance due to aircraft noise.

There's a large variation of different aircraft in use nowadays, that could each
be perceived differently. An additional constraint is therefore that the tool
should be able to simulate the audible sound of the current fleet of aircraft.


\todo{Check!}

The aim of my research is to develop a tool for the auralisation of aircraft noise in 
an urban environment. This tool can then be used to determine better annoyance 
and sleep disturbance indicators and can then be used in conjunction with a noise prediction 
model like sonAIR to give better a better estimate on how many people are affected by aircraft noise and how severe.

The auralisation tool has to support a typical urban situation where shielding 
and reflections may play an important role and should include correct over-head 
directional information. The work is therefore divided in three parts:

\begin{itemize}
 \item Development of an aircraft source synthesiser
 \item Development of propagation model
 \item Installation of reproduction system for auralisation.
 \end{itemize}
