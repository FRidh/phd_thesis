\section{Introduction}
Spatial and temporal variations in the atmosphere affect sound propagation and
can cause audible modulations. Because they can be clearly audible it is
presumed that including scintillations in auralisations increases their
perceived realism. The multiple scattering affects the phase of the signal as
well as the log-amplitude. In previous work a coherence factor was introduced
that would account for coherence loss due to phase modulations \cite{Shin2006,
Arntzen2014b, Arntzen2014a}. Fluctuations due to turbulence have also been
included in auralisations by simulating the amplitude modulations that were
observed in measurements \cite{Heutschi2014, Minard2016}.

This chapter describes a method, published in Paper \ref{paper:turbulence}, for
generating sequences of scintillations and including them in auralisations. The
method considers line-of-sight propagation through a weakly turbulent
atmosphere. Novel in this field, the method includes both log-amplitude and
phase fluctuations. The presented method is based on \cite{Jurado-navas2006}
where it was used to predict the performance of wireless communication links,
and \cite{Forssen2000} where it was used to determine the influence of
turbulence on the performance of a barrier. An early version of the method was
discussed in Papers \ref{paper:forum2014} and \ref{paper:asa2014}.

\section{Coherence loss factor}
Before presenting the new method let us consider an existing method that was
mentioned in the introduction. Arntzen developed a method to include coherence
loss \cite{Arntzen2014a,Arntzen2014b}, and the method considers a coherence factor $T_c$, first described by
Clifford and Lataitis \cite{Clifford1983}, as well as a reciprocal filter $R_c$.
Consider a typicaly scenario of a direct path and ground-reflected path. The
sound pressure at the receiver is given by
\begin{equation}
%   p = \frac{A_d}{r_d} e^{j(\left(k r_d \right) + \phi_d} + Q \frac{A_r}{r_r} e^{j(\left(k r_r \right) + \phi_r}
  p = \frac{A_d}{r_d} e^{j\left(k r_d \right) } + Q \frac{A_r}{r_r} e^{j\left(k r_r \right) }
\end{equation}
where $A$ is an amplitude, $r$ a path length, $Q=|Q|\exp{(j\phi)}$ a reflection
factor (in the referred work the spherical reflection factor), and the indices $d$ and $r$ are used to represent respectively the
direct and reflected paths.
% If $A_d=A_r=A$, then the pressure relative to free field $p/p_0$ is
% \begin{equation}
%   \frac{p}{p_0} = 1 + Q \frac{r_d}{r_r} e^{-jk\left( r_r - r_d \right)}
% \end{equation}
The effective pressure squared, as used for computing a sound pressure level, is
\begin{equation}
%   p_{e}^2 = \frac{1}{r_d^2} +  \frac{|Q|}{r_r^2} +  \frac{2 |Q|}{r_d r_r} \cos{\left(k \left( r_r - r_d \right) + \phi + \phi_r - \phi_d \right)}
  p_{e}^2 = \frac{A_d^2}{2 r_d^2} + |Q|^2 \frac{A_r^2}{2 r_r^2} + 2 |Q| \frac{A_d A_r}{r_d r_r} \cos{\left(k \left( r_r - r_d \right) + \phi  \right)}
\end{equation}
The sum of the first and second term is an incoherent addition of the direct and
ground-reflected contributions. The third term on the right-hand side considers
the interference between the direct and reflected paths.

Clifford and Lataitis considered atmospheric turbulence in a line-of-sight
propagation situations and accounted for complex phase perturbations, i.e.
log-amplitude and phase, for each propagation path. They introduced a coherence
factor $T_c$ in the third term to account for additional coherence loss due to
atmospheric turbulence in line-of-sight propagation
\begin{equation}
  p_{e}^2 = \frac{A_d^2}{2 r_d^2} + |Q|^2 \frac{A_r^2}{2 r_r^2} + 2 |Q| T_c \frac{A_d A_r}{r_d r_r} \cos{\left(k \left( r_r - r_d \right) + \phi  \right)}
\end{equation}
The factor ranges from zero to one and can nullify interference.
Assuming a spherical wave front and a Gaussian turbulence spectrum, the coherence factor is given by
\begin{equation}
  T_c = e^{-\sigma_S^2 \left(1 - C_{sp}\right)}
\end{equation}
where $\sigma_S^2$ is the variance of phase fluctuations (equation
\eqref{eq:model_daigle}), and $C_{sp}$ the phase correlation (equation
\eqref{eq:theory:propagation:turbulence:correlation}. The phase correlation is a function of the spatial separation $\rho$
perpendicular to the wave propagation direction which in this case was derived as
\begin{equation}
  \frac{1}{\rho} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{1}{h_s} + \frac{1}{h_r}  \right)
\end{equation}
where $h_d$ and $h_r$ are respectively the source and receiver height.
The variance $\sigma_S^2$ is the sum of the direct and reflected path phase variances \cite{Clifford1983}.

The interference term is implicitly included in auralisations and therefore,
Arntzen included $T_c$ as a filter for the ground-reflected path and introduced
another reciprocal filter $R_c$.
\begin{equation}
  p = R_c \frac{A_d}{r_d} e^{j\left(k r_d \right) } + Q T_c \frac{A_r}{r_r} e^{j\left(k r_r \right) }
\end{equation}
The magnitude-response of the reciprocal filter is given by
\begin{equation}
  R_c = - |Q| T_c + \sqrt{|Q|^2 + 2 |Q| T_c + 1}
\end{equation}
and is needed because the ground-reflected wave would be lost in case $T_c$ approached
zero, which will happen with strong turbulence, i.e., high values of
$\sigma^2_S$.


%TODO so...what are the conclusions?


\section{Generating sequences of scintillations}

\subsection{Space-to-time conversion}

In section \ref{theory:sound-propagation:atmospheric-turbulence} an introduction
to atmospheric turbulence was given. Consider the line-of-sight situation where
$d$ is the distance between a source and a receiver pair along the wave
propagation direction, and $\rho$ the spatial separation of the receivers
transverse to the wave propagation direction.
Still assuming Taylor's hypothesis regarding frozen turbulence, we can perform a
space-to-time conversion of the correlation and covariance functions to obtain
$C(\tau)$ and $B(\tau)$ respectively. The turbulence correlation time is given
by
\begin{equation}
 \tau_0 = \frac{L}{v_{\bot}}
\end{equation}
and the transverse time lag by
\begin{equation}
  \tau = \frac{\rho}{v_{\bot}}
\end{equation}
where $v_{\bot}$ is the transverse speed, corresponding to e.g. the mean speed
at which the field is carried by the wind transverse to the wave propagation
direction.

In this chapter the covariance for spherical waves and a Gaussian spectrum is
considered, because the Gaussian spectrum is the simplest model to work with and
computationally least demanding. The method can also be used with covariance
functions that describe other turbulence spectra, like e.g. the Von Karman
spectrum \cite{Ostashev2015}.

\subsection{Propagation in the turbulent atmosphere as a multichannel}
The fluctuations in the atmosphere are temporal and/or spatial. Therefore, to
model sound propagation of a signal $x(t)$ through such an atmosphere a
time-varying channel is necessary. The received signal $y(t)$ consists of a
line-of-sight contribution and additional contributions from scattering,
together forming a multichannel \cite{Jurado-navas2006}.
Ignoring beam spreading, this can be written as %The received signal can be written as the sum of $n$ channels
\begin{equation}
 y(t) = \sum_{n} \alpha_{sc_{n}}(t) x(t-\tau_n(t))
\end{equation}
where $\alpha_{sc_{n}}(t)$ is the time-varying scintillation sequence
representing the effect of the pressure fluctuations on the $n$th-multipath
component, and $\tau_n$ the propagation delay of the $n$th component relative to the propagation delay in an undisturbed atmosphere.
Assuming the spread in propagation delay over the channels is small compared to the inverse of the signal bandwidth, so that $x(t-\tau_n) \approx x(t - \tau(t))$, then
\begin{equation}
 y(t) = x(t - \tau(t)) \sum_n \alpha_{sc_{n}}(t)
\end{equation}
Because the attenuation is very similar for the different multipaths, we can write that
\begin{equation}\label{eq:generating_sequences_multiplicative}
 y(t) = x(t - \tau(t)) \alpha_{sc}(t)
\end{equation}
Therefore, the received signal is obtained by shifting the emitted signal $x(t)$ with a time-varying propagation delay $\tau(t)$, and multiplying the result with a time-varying gain $\alpha_{sc}(t)$.


\subsection{Design of scintillation sequence}
We will now design a sequence of scintillations and for that we need to know the
statistical distribution and power spectral density $|H_B(f)|^2$ of the desired
sequence. As mentioned before the fluctuations are Gaussian-distributed. We can
therefore generate a sequence with the correct distribution and power spectral
density by convolving a random unit variance Gaussian signal $z(t)$ with the
impulse response $h_B(t)$ of the designed filter.
\begin{equation}
 \chi(t) = S(t) = (h_B \ast z)(t)
\end{equation}

The power spectral density $|H_B(f)|^2$ of a random sequence forms a Fourier pair
with its autocorrelation function $R(\tau)$ through the Wiener-Khinchin
theorem\footnote{The Wiener-Khinchin theorem states that the autocorrelation
function of a wide-sense-stationary random process has a spectral decomposition
given by the power spectrum of that process.}. Assuming $R(\tau) \cong B_{\chi}(\tau)=B_{S}(\tau)$,
the power spectral density of $\chi$ and $S$ is
\begin{equation}
 |H_B(f)|^2 = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} B(\tau) \exp{\left(-j\omega \tau\right)} \mathrm{d}\tau
\end{equation}
This filter has zero phase and is non-causal. To create a causal filter
with constant group delay $\alpha$ we can shift the peak in the impulse response
by adding a linear-phase factor corresponding to 90 degrees
\begin{equation}
 H_B(f) = |H_B(f)|  \cdot \exp{\left(-j 2\pi f \alpha\right)}
\end{equation}
The impulse response of the filter is finally obtained through the Inverse Fourier Transform
\begin{equation}
 h_B(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} H_B(f) \exp{\left(+j\omega \tau\right)} \mathrm{d}\tau
\end{equation}

\subsection{Discrete time}
We now convert from continuous to discrete time
\begin{equation}
 H_B[k] = H_B(e^{j\omega}), \quad 0 \leq k \leq N-1, \quad  \omega = \frac{2 \pi k}{N}
\end{equation}
The linear-phase factor $\exp{\left(-j 2\pi f \alpha\right)}$ is then given by
\begin{equation}
 \exp \left\{ -j 2\pi k \frac{M_1}{2} \frac{f_s}{N} \right\}
\end{equation}
where $M_1$ is the length of the desired impulse response. The frequency response of the filter is
\begin{equation}\label{eq:discrete_time_filter}
 H_B[k] =  \sqrt{ F \left\{  B[n] \right\}  } \exp \left\{ -j 2\pi k \frac{M_1}{2} \frac{f_s}{N} \right\},  \quad 0 \leq k \leq N/2
\end{equation}
where $F\{\}$ is the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT).
The desired impulse response is real-valued. Therefore we have because of Hermitian symmetry
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
 &H_B[k] = H_B(e^{j\omega}), &\quad 0 &\leq k \leq N/2, \quad  \omega = \frac{2 \pi k}{N} \\
 &H_B[N-k] = H_B^{*} [k], &\quad 1 &\leq k \leq N/2 - 1
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
In fact, because both $B[n]$ and $|H_B[k]|$ are real and even, one can use the type-1 Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) instead of the DFT in equation \eqref{eq:discrete_time_filter}.
The impulse response of the filter is obtained by taking the Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (IDFT)
\begin{equation}
 \begin{aligned}
 h_B[n] &= F^{-1} \left\{ H_B[k] \right\} \\
  &= F^{-1} \left\{ \sqrt{ F \left\{  B[n] \right\}  } \exp \left\{ -j 2\pi \frac{M_1}{2} k \frac{f_s}{N} \right\} \right\}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Scintillations are finally obtained through the convolution of the impulse response $h_B[n]$ with Gaussian white noise $z[n]$
\begin{equation}\label{eq:scintillations_convolution_discrete}
 \chi[n] = S[n] = (z \ast h_B ) [n]
\end{equation}
The first $M_1/2$ samples would have to be dropped because of the filter delay.
A block diagram of the steps is shown in Figure \ref{fig:generating_block_diagram_simple}.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Apply scintillations to signal}
Now that we can generate sequences of fluctuations, we need to apply these to a
carrier signal $x(t)$ or $x[n]$. According to equation
\eqref{eq:generating_sequences_multiplicative} the log-amplitude fluctuations can
be applied in a multiplicative manner, which is indeed the case of a signal with
a sufficiently small bandwidth, like for example a monochromatic signal.
However, the variance of the fluctuations is frequency-dependent, and since in
practice broadband signals are commonly used, a method is sought for applying the
fluctuations to a broadband signal.

One possible method would be to decompose the input signal in complex
exponentials with the Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform, and apply per complex
exponential the log-amplitude and phase fluctuations which, when combined, can be
written as a complex exponential as shown in equations
\eqref{eq:complex_exponential} and \eqref{eq:chi_and_S}.

A computationally less demanding method is to instead filter the carrier signal
with multiple band-pass filters, and proceed with applying fluctuations to each
of the band-pass filtered signals and combining the resulting signals.
Scintillations would be computed for the center frequencies of the bands. The amplitude
fluctuations could be applied through multiplication and the phase
fluctuations could be converted to time-delay fluctuations (see equation
\eqref{eq:time_delay_fluctuations}) and applied with a Variable Delay Line (VDL).


\subsection{Scintillations as time-variant filter}
A more efficient method to take into account the frequency-dependence
of the scintillations, would be to instead convolve the carrier signal with a
time-variant filter that is updated fast enough to represent the fluctuations.

The fluctuations $\chi$ and $S$, at each time step computed for $M_2$ frequencies, can be merged into a complex phase (see equation \eqref{eq:chi_and_S})
\begin{equation}
 \psi[n] = \exp\left({\chi[n] + jS[n] }\right)
\end{equation}
Adding a linear-phase factor as was done with $h_B[n]$ and taking the Inverse
Discrete Fourier Transform will result in an impulse response for every instance
in time $n$. Convolution of the carrier signal $x[n]$ with this time-variant
filter will result in a log-amplitude and phase modulated signal. The first
$M_2/2$ samples will have to be dropped to correct for the filter delay.

Because the fluctuations are relatively low-frequent they can be sampled at a
much lower sample frequency than the carrier signal. For a correlation length
$L$ of 10 meters and a transverse speed $v_{\bot}$ of 2 meters per second the
correlation time would be 5 seconds. If we would sample the sequence of
fluctuations at 5 times the maximum bandwidth of the filter, which is
proportional to the inverse of the correlation time $\tau_0$,
\begin{equation}
 f_s = 5 / \tau_0
\end{equation}
the required sample frequency would be 1 hertz.

In practice one might want to interpolate the impulse response as it changes
over time, but because the phase also changes with time this can be problematic.
Aside from converting to a minimum-phase representation we can also create a
linear-phase filter for which the magnitude changes with time but the phase does
not. If the phase fluctuations are linear-phase, then they can be applied to the
carrier signal $x[n]$ with a Variable Delay Line. In the Gaussian model the
phase fluctuations scale as $\sigma_S^2 \sim f^2$. A scatterer affects all frequencies, and therefore the fluctuations of different frequencies move together, resulting in a linear-phase.
We therefore write the phase fluctuation $\mathrm{d}S(t)$ as a propagation delay fluctuation
\begin{equation}\label{eq:time_delay_fluctuations}
\mathrm{d}t(t) = \mathrm{d}S(t) / (2 \pi f)
\end{equation}
% TODO How does this fit with the channel, eqs. 19-22
or in discrete time
\begin{equation}
 \mathrm{d}[n] = \mathrm{d}S[n] / (2 \pi k f_s)
\end{equation}

With the Gaussian turbulence spectrum it is straightforward to separate the
covariance $B(\tau)$ into the correlation $C(\tau)$ and variance $\sigma$ as defined in respectively equations \eqref{eq:gaussian_correlation} and \eqref{eq:model_daigle}. That
way we can compute a filter $h_C[n]$ that depends solely on the correlation
$C(\tau)$, and scale this afterwards with the correct variances $\sigma_{\chi}$
and $\sigma_{S}$. The advantage is having to compute only one sequence of
fluctuations, which is determined entirely by the covariance and $z[n]$, and can
then be scaled with the (frequency-dependent) variances $\sigma_{\chi}$ and
$S$.

\subsection{Moving source}
Thus far it was assumed neither the source nor the receiver were moving, and
that the fluctuations arise due to sampling a turbulent field that is moving
by with constant speed at a fixed receiver position.

If the field is transported faster, the spatial fluctuations are sampled faster,
and therefore the scintillations $\chi[n]=S[n]$ are compressed in time
corresponding to fluctuations with relatively higher frequencies.

In case the turbulent field is transported by wind and neither source nor
receiver are moving, the source-receiver distance remains constant. If we
instead consider a moving source of which the emitted sound samples the turbulent field, then the
source-receiver distance $d$ generally changes and thus also the variances $\sigma_{\chi}$ and $\sigma_{S}$.

We will now consider a moving source. The transverse velocity is in this case
the velocity component of the moving source, perpendicular to the wave
propagation direction. This is the vector \emph{rejection} of the source
velocity vector $\mathbf{v_s}$ from the unit vector $\mathbf{\hat{o}}$ that
represents the orientation from source to receiver. The transverse speed is the
norm of this vector
\begin{equation}
 v_{\bot} = \left\| \mathbf{v_s} - (\mathbf{v_s} \cdot  \mathbf{\hat{o}} ) \cdot \mathbf{\hat{o}}  \right\|
%  v_{\bot} = \left\| \mathbf{\hat{o}} \times \mathbf{v_s} \right\|
\end{equation}
The vector \emph{projection} of the source velocity on the wave propagation
direction is the component that is relevant for the Doppler shift. Therefore, as
the Doppler shift is maximum the modulations are relatively low-frequent,
whereas if the Doppler shift is zero, the modulations are relatively
high-frequent.

When computing two sequences of scintillations, but for different
transverse speeds, one does not obtain a compressed version of the other using
the method as described thus far in this section, even when using the same seed
for the Pseudo-Random Number Generator. This is because, by adjusting $v_{\bot}$,
we effectively applied the compression on the filter $h_C[n]$ before convolution
with $z[n]$. Therefore, the two resulting sequences will not look compressed in
time, but instead just filtered differently. Even so, the generated sequence will
have the desired statistical properties.

We can obtain the desired compression, i.e., scaling in time, if we instead
perform the convolution between $z[n]$ and a time-invariant $h_C[n]$ computed for a fixed $\tau_0$, $\tau_{\mathrm{ref}}$, and then
resample the values of $\chi[n]$ and $S[n]$ at different times to take into
account the change in correlation. Instead of having a constant sample timestep
\begin{equation}
 t_k = \frac{k}{f_s} = \sum_{i=0}^k \frac{1}{f_s}, \quad k=0, 1, \dots, \quad i=0, 1, \dots
\end{equation}
the sample time varies with correlation time
\begin{equation}
  t_k = \sum_{i=0}^k \frac{\tau_{\mathrm{ref}}}{\tau_{0,i}} \frac{1}{f_s} , \quad k=0, 1, \dots, \quad i=0, 1, \dots
\end{equation}

Figure \ref{fig:generating_block_diagram} shows the full block diagram of the signal
processing steps for generating scintillations and including them in an auralization.


\subsection{Saturation of the log-amplitude fluctuations}
According to equation \eqref{eq:model_daigle} the fluctuations increase with distance and frequency indefinitely.
For longer path lengths or stronger turbulence, the amplitude fluctuations
gradually level off. Saturation of the amplitude fluctuations can be observed
when measuring aircraft noise at distances of over a few kilometers. The
standard deviation of the fluctuating sound pressure levels is in such cases
limited to approximately 6 dB \cite{Daigle1983}.

Saturation of the log-amplitude fluctuations can be included based on an analysis by Wenzel
\cite{Wenzel1975}. In Wenzel's approach the soundwave is split up in a coherent
and incoherent wave. The amplitude of the coherent wave decreases over distance
while the incoherent wave obtains the energy from the coherent wave. The
coherent wave $p$ is written as
\begin{equation}
 \langle p \  p^* \rangle = \left( A_m^2 / 4 \pi r^2 \right) \exp{\left( -2 \langle \mu^2 \rangle k^2 r L \right)}
\end{equation}
Wenzel defines the distance to saturation $r_s$ as the distance at which the coherent wave is reduced to $e^{-1}$ of its original strength
\begin{equation}\label{eq:saturation_distance}
 r_s = \frac{1}{2 \sigma_{\mu}^2 k^2 L}
\end{equation}
Saturation of the log-amplitude fluctuations can now be included by multiplying the log-amplitude with a correction factor.
The variance of log-amplitude fluctuations that includes saturation $\sigma_{\chi}$, is given by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:saturation_logamp}
 \sigma_{\chi, sat} = \sigma_{\chi} \frac{ 1}{1 + r/r_s}
\end{equation}

\section{Results}

\subsection{A single tone}
To demonstrate the model we shall now consider a tone of 1000 Hz and apply modulations to the tone.
The following parameters are used: $c=343.2$
m/s, $\sigma_{\mu}^2=3\cdot10^{-6}$, $L=1.1$ m, $v_{\bot}=2.0$ m/s and $d=500$
m. Saturation according to equation \eqref{eq:saturation_logamp} is also included.
The filter $h_c$ is designed to have 8192 taps. The correlation time is then
$\tau=L/v_{\bot}=0.55$ s and the sample frequency at which the modulations are
generated $5/\tau=9.1$ Hz.

Figure \ref{fig:results_tone_logamp_and_phase} shows the time series of
amplitude and phase fluctuations that were generated. Figure
\ref{fig:results_tone_levels} shows the tone along with a modulated version of
the tone. The tone was sampled at 8000 Hz.

The log-amplitude and phase move in-phase. The value for the log-amplitude is slightly lower than that of the phase because of saturation.
As expected the phase fluctuations cause spectral broadening of the tone as can be seen in Figure \cite{Ostashev2016}.

  \caption{The power spectrum of the tone shows the broadening due to the phase fluctuations.}
  \label{fig:results_tone_broadening}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Scintillations as function of transverse speed}
By changing the transverse speed the refractive-index field is sampled at a
different speed. This effectively changes the correlation length and shifts the frequency range that is covered by our applied filter \cite{Wilson1999}.

Figure \ref{fig:results_scintillations_correlation} shows the correlation function for
different transverse speeds.
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[]{../figures/generated/turbulence-tone/correlation}
  \caption{Correlation as function of time for different transverse speeds given in meters per second.}
  \label{fig:results_scintillations_correlation}
\end{figure}
With a high transverse speed the correlation drops
faster, and this will result in relatively more high-frequency fluctuations, as is shown in Figure \ref{fig:results_scintillations_levels}.
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[]{../figures/generated/turbulence-tone/scintillations_levels}
  \caption{Sound pressure level as function of time for scintillations
corresponding to different transverse speeds given in meters per second. The
same $z[n]$ were used for each case. A compression in time of the modulations with increasing velocity can be observed.}
  \label{fig:results_scintillations_levels}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Application in auralization of aircraft}
The method was developed in order to create more realistic sounding
auralizations of aircraft. An aircraft moves at high speed through the
atmosphere. A transverse speed is computed for each propagation path separately.
Because the correlation time, distance and propagation varies between the two
paths, decorrelation occurs. Figures \ref{fig:results_auralization_without} and
\ref{fig:results_auralization_with} show spectrograms respectively with and
without turbulence. The vertical lines that can be seen are the amplitude
modulations.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[]{../figures/manual/turbulence-model/auralisation_flight_without}
  \caption{Spectrogram of an auralization of an aircraft taking off.
Scintillations were not included. Visible are the ground effect and the Doppler
shift. In the initial seconds a high amount of tonal components are visible.
  }
  \label{fig:results_auralization_without}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[]{../figures/manual/turbulence-model/auralisation_flight_both}
  \caption{Spectrogram of the same event as in Figure
  \ref{fig:results_auralization_without}, however, this time with scintillations included. Because of the high speed at which the aircraft samples the refractive-index field the scintillations are relatively high-frequent, resulting in vertical lines.}
  \label{fig:results_auralization_with}
\end{figure}

Earlier it was assumed that the correlation length was much smaller than the Fresnel zone size.
In this auralization the aircraft is moving close to the receiver. When the aircraft is closest, the distance is almost entirely given by the height which was approximately 100 meters.
The correlation length was set at 20 meters. In that case the Fresnel zone is larger than the correlation length for the lower frequencies, and equation \eqref{eq:model_daigle} is not valid.
Instead, the log-amplitude and phase variances should scale with respectively $d^3$ and $2k^2 d$ instead of $k^2 d$ \cite{Ishimaru1997}.

\section{Conclusion}
Fluctuations in the refractive-index field due to variations in temperature and
wind affects sound propagation and causes audible modulations. A method was
presented for generating sequences of modulations and applying these to
monochromatic as well as broadband signals.

A Rytov approximation to first-order refractive-index flucutuations results in a complex
phase which we can write as a log-amplitude $\chi$ and phase $S$ fluctuation.
The propagating sound is modelled as a time-varying channel where we consider
two sequences, one for the log-amplitude fluctuations, and another for the phase
fluctuations.

The fluctuations are frequency-dependent and therefore a filter was designed to take that into account.
% A Gaussian applied filter was used to model the atmospheric turbulence because of its simplicity and because it is computationally least demanding.
A Gaussian turbulence spectrum was considered, but the general method can be
used with other turbulence spectra as well. The Von Karman spectrum describes
real turbulence spectra typically better than the Gaussian spectrum, however,
the Von Karman spectrum is computationally much more demanding.
% The Gaussian model also allows implementing the phase fluctuation with a Variable Delay Line (VDL).

Examples are shown where the method is applied to a tone and to an aircraft
auralization. The aircraft auralization spectrogram shows several spikes
corresponding to amplitude modulations as well as an increase in the amount of
decorrelation. Furthermore the transverse velocity dependence on the frequency
content of the modulations is demonstrated.

According to the author the method results in more realistic sounding
auralizations, but this has not been validated yet with listening tests.
