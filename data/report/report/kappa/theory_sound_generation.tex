\section{Generation of sound}

\subsection{Aerodynamic sound sources}\label{sec:theory:sound:aerodynamic}
Classical acoustics provides a method for modelling sound generation due to
vibrating solid boundaries. Aerodynamic sources such as combustion or other
unsteady fluid processes cannot be handled, however. With the development of
jet-powered aircraft a description was needed to model such sources. Lighthill
provided the theory to take into account aerodynamic sources. The idea is that
an unsteady flow will produce sound. A simple example is the sound that is
generated when flow passes a string or antenna.
The aero-acoustic analogy of Lighthill is the idea of representing a fluid
mechanical process that acts as an acoustic source by an acoustically equivalent
source term.

% He drew an analogy between the non-homogeneous versions of the fluid equations and the classical
% wave equation including the single acoustic source term.

Taking the time derivative of the homogeneous version of the mass conservation
equation and the divergence of the homogeneous version of the momentum
conservation equation, then subtracting one from another, and finally
subtracting from both sides of the equation $c^2 \nabla^2 \rho$, results in the
Lighthill equation
\begin{equation}\label{eq:theory:sound:generation:lighthill}
  \frac{\partial^2 \rho}{\partial t^2} - c^2 \nabla^2 \rho = \nabla \cdot \nabla \cdot \matr{T}
\end{equation}
where $\matr{T}$ is the Lighthill stress tensor
\begin{equation}
  \matr{T} = \rho \vect{u}\vect{u} + \left( p - c^2 \rho \right) \matr{I} - \matr{\tau}
\end{equation}
The right-hand side of the Lighthill equation describes the non-homogeneous
fluid in a finite volume $V$. This area is called the source region or source
field. The left-hand side of the equation describes a homogeneous fluid. This
region is called the sound field and is where the classical wave equation
governs sound propagation.

The Lighthill stress tensor can be considered as a source term of a jet in an
acoustic medium at rest and consists of three aero-acoustic processes that are
sources of sound \cite{Rienstra2017}. The first are non-linear convective forces
as described by the Reynold stress tensor $\rho \vect{u}\vect{u}$, the second
viscous forces $\tau$ and the third deviations from isentropic behaviour $p - c^2 \rho$.


% A limitation of Lighthill's analogy is that it cannot handle situations where
% feedback occurs because the source field is decoupled from the sound field.


% Lighthill's acoustic analogy has the limitation that the source field is not
% coupled to the acoustic field. That means situations where feedback occurs,
% i.e., the acoustic field modifies the flow field and vice versa, cannot be
% treated.


% The Mach number $M = v / c$ represents the ratio of the flow velocity to the
% local speed of sound.

\subsection{Elementary sources}
The Lighthill equation is an exact reformulation of the fundamental equations.
Equation \eqref{eq:theory:sound:generation:lighthill} is the density-based
variant of the Lighthill equation. Linearisation of the pressure-based variant
results in
\begin{equation}
 \frac{1}{c_0^2}\frac{\partial^2 p'}{\partial t^2} - \frac{\partial^2 p'}{\partial x_i^2} = \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \left( m + \frac{1}{c_0^2}\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(p' - c_0^2 \rho' \right) \right) - \frac{\partial f_i}{\partial x_i} + \frac{\partial^2 }{\partial x_i x_j} \left( \rho u_i u_j - \tau_{ij} \right)
\end{equation}
where Cartesian tensor notation is used.
The source term can be split into the following three parts
\begin{align}
  s_1 &= \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \left( m + \frac{1}{c_0^2}\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(p' - c_0^2 \rho' \right) \right) \\
  s_2 &= - \frac{\partial f_i}{\partial x_i} \\
  s_3 &= \frac{\partial^2 }{\partial x_i x_j} \left( \rho u_i u_j - \tau_{ij} \right)
\end{align}
which are respectively the monopole, dipole and quadrupole source terms.

% In case a source is compact, i.e., it is small compared to the wavelength, then the source
% distribution can be written as a multipole.

The source mechanisms of the monopole source are mass injection and deviations
from adiabatic behaviour. The dipole source term represents an unsteady force
acting on the fluid. The quadrupole source term describes noise due to unsteady
momentum transport $\rho u_i u_j$. The viscous forces $\tau_{ij}$ can be
neglected because they are typically much smaller than the momentum
transportation term and therefore hardly contribute in case of high Reynolds
numbers. The quadrupole source term is the main noise source of a high-speed jet.


\subsection{Moving source}
Motion of the medium and/or motion of the source affects the produced sound field.
% A well known effect related to motion is the Doppler shift, which will be
% The sound field produced by a moving source is different from that of a fixed source.
% Motion of a source can result in a Doppler shift as well as strong directivity.

\subsubsection*{Convective wave equation}\todo{keep this for other section?}
A mean flow has an effect on sound generation and propagation.
The material derivative $D/Dt$ is defined as
\begin{equation}
  \frac{D}{Dt} = \frac{\partial}{\partial t} + \vect{u} \nabla
\end{equation}
and is a time derivative of some physical quantity for a portion of a material
moving with a velocity $\vect{u}$.

Taking the material derivative of the linearised mass conservation equation and
subtracting the divergence of the linearised momentum conservation equation
results in the convective wave equation.
% \begin{equation}
%   \frac{\partial^2 \rho'}{\partial t^2} + \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \left( 2 \left( \vect{u}_0 \cdot \nabla \right) \rho' \right) + \left( \vect{u}_0 \cdot \nabla \right) \left( \vect{u}_0 \nabla \rho' \right) - \nabla^2 p' = 0
% \end{equation}
Assuming an adiabatic process gives
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\partial^2 p'}{\partial t^2} + \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \left( 2 \left( \vect{u}_0 \cdot \nabla \right) p' \right) + \left( \vect{u}_0 \cdot \nabla \right)^2 p' - c^2 \nabla^2 p' = 0
\end{equation}


\subsubsection*{Convective amplification}
Another effect that occurs and is especially relevant for fast-moving sources is
convective amplification.

\begin{align}
 p_{m} \propto \left( 1 - M_e \right)^{-2} \\
 p_{d} \propto \left( 1 - M_e \right)^{-2} \\
 p_{q} \propto \left( 1 - M_e \right)^{-3} \\
\end{align}
Strong directivity can therefore occur for fast-moving sources.
