\section{Sound}

A repetitive variation about a central value of some quantity is called an
oscillation. Oscillations of mechanical nature are vibrations. An
oscillation travelling through a medium and transferring energy is a wave. Sound
is then a mechanical wave travelling through a fluid medium. Furthermore, only
those oscillations that can be perceived by the human brain are typically
considered sound.
Being a small repetitive perturbation about the barometric
mean pressure of the medium, the fluctuating or dynamic part of the pressure,
denoted sound pressure, is typically many orders smaller than the mean
pressure.

In the \nth{17} century Newton proposed a model for sound waves in elastic media
in his Principia. Already aware that the humidity of the air influences the
speed of sound, Newton assumed an isothermal process for the wave motion and
thereby computed incorrect values for the speed of sound. Laplace gave the
correct derivation of the classical wave equation, describing the wave motion as
a adiabatic process. In the \nth{19} century Kirchoff described the motion of a
rigid body in an ideal fluid and Helmholtz gave a time-independent form of the
wave equation. These were some of the important foundations for the classical
theory of sound.
% A limitation of the developed theory was the lack of sound generation models. In
% the classical theory sound was only generated through a vibrating solid
% boundary. In the 1950s
In this section a brief overview is given of sound. Discussed are sound
generation, propagation, and the effect of flow.

\subsection{Wave equation}\label{sec:theory:sound:wave}
% In his Principia, Newton gave an description of sound and a value of the speed of sound.
The wave equation is a differential equation for describing waves and is used
throughout physics. In the \nth{18} century d'Alembert discovered the
one-dimensional wave equation, and a couple of years later Euler presented the
three-dimensional wave equation. The acoustic wave equation describes the motion
of sound waves and can be derived from the fundamental laws of fluid dynamics \cite{Arntzen2014a, Rienstra2017}.

\subsubsection*{Mass and momentum conservation}
The mass conservation or continuity equation is given by
% Mass conservation equation
\begin{equation}\label{eq:theory:sound:wave:mass}
 \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot \left( \rho \vect{u} \right) = m
\end{equation}
with $\rho$ the density of the medium, $t$ the time, $\vect{u}$ the flow velocity
vector, $m$ the mass and $\nabla = \left( \frac{\partial}{\partial
x_1},\frac{\partial}{\partial x_2},\frac{\partial}{\partial x_3} \right)$.
The momentum conservation equation is
% Momentum conservation equation
\begin{equation}\label{eq:theory:sound:wave:momentum}
 \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \rho \vect{u} + \nabla \cdot \left(\matr{P} + \rho \vect{u} \vect{u}  \right) = \vect{f} + m \vect{u}
\end{equation}
where $\vect{u} \vect{u}$ is a dyadic product\footnote{The dyadic product of the vectors $\vect{a}$ and $\vect{b}$ is the tensor $\vect{a}\vect{b}=a_i b_j$}, $\vect{f}$ the external force
density and $\matr{P}$ the fluid stress tensor. The fluid stress tensor relates the pressure $p$ and the viscous stress tensor $\matr{\tau}$ by
% Viscous stress tensor
\begin{equation}
  \matr{P} = p \matr{I} - \matr{\tau}
\end{equation}
where $\matr{I}$ is a unit tensor. Viscous stresses are small compared to inertial
forces. Assuming an ideal fluid by ignoring the viscous stresses, and rewriting equation
\ref{eq:theory:sound:wave:momentum} using equation
\ref{eq:theory:sound:wave:mass}, we obtain the following form for the momentum conservation equation
\begin{equation}
 \rho \left( \frac{\partial \vect{u}}{\partial t} + \left( \vect{u} \cdot \nabla \right) \vect{u} \right) + \nabla p = \vect{f}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection*{Linearisation}
Sound is a small perturbation of a steady state, and so we can apply linearisation to obtain a wave equation.
Ignoring the source term at the right-hand side (thus considering the homogeneous solution), the linearised versions of the mass and momentum equations are given by
% Linearised versions of the homogeneous (= without source terms) mass and momentum equations
\begin{align}
 \frac{\partial \rho'}{\partial t} + \vect{u_0} \cdot \nabla \rho' + \rho_0 \nabla \cdot \vect{u'} = 0  \label{eq:theory:sound:linearisation:mass} \\
% \end{equation}
% \begin{equation}
 \rho_0 \left( \frac{\partial \vect{u'}}{\partial t} + \left(\vect{u_0} \cdot \nabla \right) \vect{u'}\right) + \nabla p' = 0 \label{eq:theory:sound:linearisation:momentum}
\end{align}
with the fluctuating components of the variables denoted with a prime and the steady components subscripted with a zero.

\subsubsection*{Speed of sound}
Viscosity is neglected and thereby also heat transfer. The fluid is considered to behave
adiabatic and thus the following relation between pressure and density
fluctuations can be used
% Adiabatic relation between pressure and density fluctuations
\begin{equation}
  p' = c^2 \rho'
\end{equation}
where $c$ is the speed of sound
% Speed of sound for adiabatic process
\begin{equation}
  c = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\partial p}{\partial \rho} \right)_{s} }
\end{equation}
The subscript $s$ indicates an isentropic (constant entropy $s$) or adiabatic process.
In general, the speed of sound is given by $c = \sqrt{\frac{K}{\rho}}$ where $K$
is the bulk modulus of the medium. For ideal gases the bulk modulus is $K=\gamma
p$ where $\gamma=C_p/C_v$ is the ratio of specific heat capacities at constant
pressure $C_p$ and constant volume $C_V$.

\subsubsection*{Convective wave equation}
A mean flow has an effect on sound generation and propagation.
The material derivative $D/Dt$ is defined as
\begin{equation}
  \frac{D}{Dt} = \frac{\partial}{\partial t} + \vect{u} \nabla
\end{equation}
and is a time derivative of some physical quantity for a portion of a material moving with a velocity $\vect{u}$.

Taking the material derivative of the linearised mass conservation equation and subtracting the divergence of the
linearised momentum conservation equation results in the convective wave equation.
% \begin{equation}
%   \frac{\partial^2 \rho'}{\partial t^2} + \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \left( 2 \left( \vect{u}_0 \cdot \nabla \right) \rho' \right) + \left( \vect{u}_0 \cdot \nabla \right) \left( \vect{u}_0 \nabla \rho' \right) - \nabla^2 p' = 0
% \end{equation}
Assuming an adiabatic process, the convective wave equation then becomes
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\partial^2 \rho'}{\partial t^2} + \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \left( 2 \left( \vect{u}_0 \cdot \nabla \right) p' \right) + \left( \vect{u}_0 \cdot \nabla \right)^2 p' - c^2 \nabla^2 p' = 0
\end{equation}

\subsubsection*{Classical wave equation}
The convective wave equation considers a flow with a velocity $\vect{u}$. If the velocity is zero, the equation reduces to the classical wave equation
\begin{equation}\label{eq:theory:sound:wave:classic}
 \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2 p'}{\partial t^2} - \nabla^2 p' = 0
\end{equation}

\subsubsection*{Harmonic wave}
In acoustics harmonic waves in the following complex form are typically considered
\begin{equation}
  p' (\vect{x}, t) = \hat{p} \left(\vect{x}\right) \exp{\left(j \omega t \right)}
\end{equation}
where $\hat{p} \left(\vect{x}\right)$ is the amplitude of the wave and $\omega=2 \pi f$ the angular frequency.

\subsubsection*{Helmholtz equation}
Inserting (the derivatives of) a harmonic wave in the wave equation results in
the Helmholtz equation
\begin{equation}\label{eq:theory:sound:wave:helmholtz}
 \left( \nabla^2 + k^2 \right) \hat{p} = 0
\end{equation}
where $k=w/c$ is the wavenumber.

\subsubsection*{Plane wave solution}
The solution to the wave equation in one dimension is
\begin{equation}
  p'(x,t) = p'_{+} (t-x/c) + p'_{-} (t+x/c)
\end{equation}
where $p'_{+}$ and $p'_{-}$ are respectively a right and left travelling function.

\subsubsection*{Spherical wave solution}
A solution in three dimensions assuming spherical symmetry is the spherical wave solution
\begin{equation}
  p'(r,t) = \frac{1}{r} p'_{+} (t-r/c) + \frac{1}{r} p'_{-} (t+r/c)
\end{equation}
and looks similar to the plane wave solution. In this expression $r$ is the
distance travelled by the wave. The spherical wave solution represents the sum
of a wave propagating out from the origin and that of a wave propagating towards
the origin. In acoustics only the outgoing wave is typically kept. Contrary to
a plane wave the pressure of a spherical wave decreases with $1/r$.

\subsubsection*{Wave equation with source terms}
The above solutions considered a homogeneous wave equation and therefore do not
take into account any source terms. Linearisation of the mass and momentum equations
would have resulted in a unsteady mass injection $m'$ and unsteady external
force $\vect{f'}$ that correspond to a vibrating solid boundary. The wave equation with these terms is
\begin{equation}
   \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2 p'}{\partial t^2} - \nabla^2 p' = \frac{\partial m'}{\partial t} - \nabla \cdot \vect{f}'
\end{equation}
In general a source term can be written as a source $s(\vect{x}, t)$.

\subsubsection*{Green's function}\label{sec:theory:sound:green}
The simplest possible source is a point source that is represented by a Dirac
delta function $\delta(\vect{x}-\vect{x}_0)$ where $\vect{x}_0$ is the position
of the point source. A Green's function is a solution or impulse response of an
inhomogeneous linear differential equation.
Therefore, the solution of the wave equation with such a point source excitation
is a Green's function. For a harmonic point source the Green's function
$\hat{G}$ should satisfy
\begin{equation}
  \left( \nabla^2 + k^2 \right) \hat{G} = - \delta \left( \vect{x} - \vect{x}_0 \right)
\end{equation}
Note that because a harmonic point source is considered the Helmholtz equation
is used.

The solution of this inhomogeneous Helmholtz equation is again an
ingoing and outgoing spherical wave. Because of causality we consider only the
outgoing wave. In free field the Green's function of this outgoing wave is
\begin{equation}
  \hat{G} = \frac{\exp{\left(jkr\right)}}{4 \pi r}
\end{equation}
with $r = \left| \vect{x} - \vect{x}_0 \right|$ the distance from point source to receiver.
% The point source represented by a Dirac delta pulse is a monopole point source of unit amplitude
% and the resulting field is a monopole field.

% Free-field solution
% \begin{equation}
%  G = \frac{1}{4 \pi r} \delta \left( t - \tau - \frac{r}{c} \right)
% \end{equation}

\subsection{Aerodynamic sound sources}\label{sec:theory:sound:aerodynamic}
Classical acoustics provides a method for modeling sound generation due to
vibrating solid boundaries. Aerodynamic sources such as combustion or other
unsteady fluid processes cannot be handled, however. With the development of
jet-powered aircraft a description was needed to model such sources. Lighthill
provided the theory to take into account aerodynamic sources. The idea is that
an unsteady flow will produce sound. A simple example is the sound that is
generated when flow passes a string or antenna.
The aero-acoustic analogy of Lighthill is the idea of representing a fluid
mechanical process that acts as an acoustic source by an acoustically equivalent
source term.

% He drew an analogy between the non-homogeneous versions of the fluid equations and the classical
% wave equation including the single acoustic source term.

Taking the time derivative of the homogeneous version of the mass conservation
equation and the divergence of the homogeneous version of the momentum
conservation equation, then subtracting one from another, and finally
subtracting from both sides of the equation $c^2 \nabla^2 \rho$, results in the
Lighthill equation
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\partial^2 \rho}{\partial t^2} - c^2 \nabla^2 \rho = \nabla \cdot \nabla \cdot \matr{T}
\end{equation}
where $\matr{T}$ is the Lighthill stress tensor
\begin{equation}
  \matr{T} = \rho \vect{u}\vect{u} + \left( p - c^2 \rho \right) \matr{I} - \matr{\tau}
\end{equation}
The right-hand side of the Lighthill equation describes the non-homogeneous
fluid in a finite volume $V$. This area is called the source region or source
field. The left-hand side of the equation is called the sound field, it
describes the homogeneous fluid and this is where the classical wave equation
governs sound propagation.

The Lighthill stress tensor consists of three aero-acoustic processes that are sources of sound \cite{Rienstra2017}:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item non-linear convective forces as described by the stress tensor $\rho \vect{u}\vect{u}$,
  \item viscous forces $\tau$,
  \item deviations from a uniform soundspeed $c_0$ or isentropic behaviour $p' - c_0^2 \rho'$. \todo{requires linearisation}
\end{enumerate}

% Lighthill's acoustic analogy has the limitation that the source field is not
% coupled to the acoustic field. That means situations where feedback occurs,
% i.e., the acoustic field modifies the flow field and vice versa, cannot be
% treated.


% The Mach number $M = v / c$ represents the ratio of the flow velocity to the
% local speed of sound.

\subsection{Moving source}
The sound field produced by a moving source is different from that of a fixed source.

\subsubsection{Doppler shift}
A commonly known effect related to movement is the Doppler shift.
Movements of source, receiver and medium can cause
Doppler shifts. If we consider a moving harmonic point source, $S(t) = \hat{S}_0
\exp{\left(j\omega_0 t\right)} $, in a homogeneous fluid at rest, then the sound
field is given by
\begin{equation}
  p'(\vect{x},t) = \sum_{t_e} \frac{\hat{S}_0 \exp{\left(j \omega_0 t_e\right)}}{4\pi r \left(t_e\right) \abs{1-M_r (t_e)}}
\end{equation}
and represents a summation of the sound pressure contributions at all emision
times $t_e$. The Mach number $M_r = \vect{M} \cdot \vect{e}_r = M \cos{\theta}$ is
the projection of the Mach number of the source in the direction towards the
receiver. The Mach number of the source is $\vect{M}=\vect{v}/c$ and
$\vect{e}_r=\vect{r}/r$ is the unit vector pointing towards the receiver.
If we consider a moving source and fixed receiver, then the instantaneous
frequency is given by
\begin{equation}
  \omega = \frac{\omega_0}{1 - M_r(t_e)}
\end{equation}
% with $M_r(t_e) = M(t_e) \cos{\theta(t_e)}$.

\subsubsection{Convective amplification}
Another effect that occurs and is especially relevant for fast-moving sources is
convective amplification.

\subsection{Atmospheric attenuation}\label{sec:theory_sound_atmospheric_attenuation}
As sound waves travel through an atmosphere the waves are attenuated through
atmospheric attenuation. There are two effects causing attenuation. The first
effect causing attenuation is classical heat conduction and shear viscosity.
These effects were considered insignificant when deriving the wave equation. The
second effect is on a molecular scale and is due to an energy exchange between
translation and rotational or vibrational modes. Molecules collide and are
excited when a wave passes resulting in energy transfer. The energy transfer is
a function of the relaxation time of the molecules. Because the molecules need a
certain time to reach equilibrium the heat capacity of the medium is
time-dependent thus resulting in an irreversible process causing losses.

A model for atmospheric attenuation is given in Part 1 of ISO 9613-1:1993 \cite{ISO9613-1}.
The attenuation coefficient $\alpha$, in dB/m, is given by
\begin{align}\label{eq:theory:sound:atmospheric-attenuation}
 \alpha &= 8.686 f^2 \Biggl( \left[ 1.84 \times 10^{-11} \left(\frac{p_r}{p_a}\right)^{-1} \left(\frac{T}{T_0}\right)^{1/2} \right] + \left(\frac{T}{T_0}\right)^{-5/2} \nonumber \\ 
 &\times \Biggl\{ 0.01275 \left[ \exp{\frac{-2239.1}{T}} \right]  \left[f_{r,O} + \frac{f^2}{f_{r,O}} \right]^{-1} \nonumber \\
 &+ 0.1068 \left[ \exp{\frac{-3352.0}{T}} \right] \left[ f_{r,N} + \frac{f^2}{f_{r,N}} \right]^{-1} \Biggr\} \Biggr) 
\end{align}
and is a function of the ambient temperature in kelvin $T$, the reference
temperature $T_0=293.15$ K, the ambient pressure $p_a$ in kilopascal, the
reference pressure $p_r=101.325$ kPa and the relaxation frequencies for oxygen 
$f_{r,O}$ and nitrogen $f_{r,N}$.
The relaxation frequency of oxygen is given by
\begin{equation}
 f_{r,O} = \frac{p_a}{p_r} \left( 24 + 4.04 \cdot 10^4 h \frac{0.02 + h}{0.391 + h}  \right)
\end{equation}
and the relaxation frequency of nitrogen by
\begin{equation}
 f_{r,N} = \frac{p_a}{p_r} \left( \frac{T}{T_0} \right)^{-1/2} \cdot \left( 9 + 280 h \exp{\left\{ -4.170 \left[ \left(\frac{T}{T_0} \right)^{-1/3} -1 \right] \right\} } \right)
\end{equation}
Both depend on the molar concentration of water vapour $h$, given by
\begin{equation}
 h = h_r  \frac{p_{sat}}{p_a}
\end{equation}
The molar concentration of water vapour is a function of the saturation pressure
\begin{equation}
 p_{sat} = 10^C \cdot p_r
\end{equation}
where 
\begin{equation}
 C = -6.8346 \cdot \left( \frac{T_{01}}{T} \right)^{1.261}  + 4.6151
\end{equation}
In this equation $T_{01}$ is the triple-point isotherm temperature of 273.16 K.

The standard furthermore mentions the following expression for the speed of sound
\begin{equation}
c = 343.2 \left( \frac{T}{T_0} \right)
\end{equation}

\subsection{Reflections}
Sound hitting a boundary between materials of different impedance may be
transmitted, reflected or absorbed. When sound is transmitted the incident wave
is partially refracted. Sound reflected by a smooth surface results in a
specular reflection, and sound reflected on a rough surface results in a diffuse
reflection. In outdoor situations sound is typically reflected by the ground
surface and other obstacles like buildings. The sound pressure at a receiver is
then the sum of the direct contribution as well as indirect contributions from
reflections. Due to this superposition strong interference effects may occur.

\subsubsection*{Impedance}
An impedance is a complex ratio between two interdependent dynamic quantities
and describes the resistance to a direct flow (resistance) and alternating flow
(reactance). The specific acoustical impedance of a material is the ratio of the
sound pressure to the particle velocity normal to the surface $Z_{s} =
p/\vect{u}$. The specific acoustical impedance of a material or surface
normalised by the impedance of air $Z_{s, air} = \rho c$ is called the
normalised specific acoustic impedance. This impedance is typically used to
characterise surfaces, and is what impedance in the following text refers to.

Multiple models are available for the prediction of the impedance of a surface.
Attenborough et. al. made a comparison of impedance models and recommends the
Delany and Bazley one-parameter model for predicting outdoor ground impedance
\cite{Attenborough2011a}. The empirical one-parameter model by Delaney and
Bazley is widely used and depends on the flow resistivity of the material
$\sigma$ and the frequency $f$
\begin{equation}\label{eq:theory:sound:impedance:db}
 Z = 1 + 9.08 \left( \frac{1000f}{\sigma}\right)^{-0.75} - 11.9 j \left( \frac{1000f}{\sigma}\right)^{-0.73}
\end{equation}
Flow resistivity describes how difficult it is for air to flow through a
surface. Values for surfaces can vary significantly, with average values ranging
from \SI{29}{\kilo\pascal\second\per\square\meter} for snow to
\SI{200000}{\kilo\pascal\second\per\square\meter} for painted concrete. Grass
has an average flow resistivity of
\SI{200}{\kilo\pascal\second\per\square\meter} \cite{Crocker1997}.
Furthermore, a surface is called locally reacting if at a certain point the
particle velocity $\vect{u}$ depends only on the sound pressure $p$ at that
point. In case it doesn't the surface has an extended reaction.
Figure \ref{fig:theory:sound:impedance} shows the impedance of grass according to the Delaney and Bazley model.

\end{figure}


%
% Another example of a model is the 2-parameter model by Attenborough. In this model, the impedance is given by
% \begin{equation}\label{eq:theory:sound:impedance:att}
%  Z = \frac{\left( 1-j\right) \sqrt{\sigma/f}}{\sqrt{\pi \gamma_0 \rho_0}} - \frac{jc\alpha}{8 \pi \gamma_0 f}
% \end{equation}
% and depends on the speed of sound in air $c_0$, the density of air $\rho_0$, $\alpha$, $\gamma_0$ and again the flow resistivity $\sigma$ and frequency $f$.

\subsubsection{Reflection coefficient}
The pressure reflection coefficient describes the ratio between the sound
pressure of an incident wave $p_i$ and the pressure of the reflected wave $p_r$
and considers a wave incident on an infinite plane that is locally
reacting and has impedance $Z$
\begin{equation}
  R = \frac{p_r}{p_i}
\end{equation}
The plane wave reflection coefficient gives the ratio of incident and reflected pressure assuming the incident wave is plane
\begin{equation}\label{eq:theory:sound:reflection:plane}
  R = \frac{Z\cos{\theta}-1}{Z\cos{\theta}+1}
\end{equation}
and is a function of the angle of incidence $\theta$ of the incident wave.
If the source is relatively close to the reflecting surface,
then typically the wave front is not plane. In such case a spherical wave
reflection factor is used that considers an incident spherical wave.

The impedance and reflection coefficient models together with their parameters
determine in computations how much sound is reflected and how much is
transmitted or absorbed. Because the reflection coefficient is complex-valued
the reflected contribution may have not only a different magnitude than the
direct contribution, but also an additional frequency-dependent phase shift or
propagation delay. Surfaces that attenuate and phase shift the reflected wave
are called acoustically soft surfaces. In case the normalised impedance
approaches infinity, neither attenuation nor phase shift occur, and the surface
is considered acoustically hard. Figure \ref{fig:theory:sound:reflection} shows
both the absolute value and the phase angle of the plane wave reflection angle
as function of frequency and angle of incidence.

% Another commonly used reflection coefficient is the spherical wave reflection coefficient.

% The spherical reflection coefficient is given by
% \begin{equation}\label{eq:theory:sound:reflection:spherical}
%  Q = R \left(1 - R \right) F
% \end{equation}
% with
% \begin{equation}
%  F = 1 - j \sqrt{ \pi} w e^{-w^2} \mathrm{erfc} \left( j w \right)
% \end{equation}
% and
% \begin{equation}
%  w = \sqrt{-j k r  \left( 1 + \frac{1}{Z} \cos{\theta} - \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{1}{Z} \right)^2} \sin{\theta} \right) }
% \end{equation}

\subsubsection{Ground effect}
In outdoor situations the ground is typically providing the second-largest
contribution and is important when considering an elevated source. As mentioned
before, impedances of surfaces can vary significantly, and this is especially
the case for the ground surface. Spectrograms of recordings of aircraft often
show a distinct interference pattern called the Lloyd's mirror effect. Figure
\ref{fig:theory:sound:reflection:ground} shows a (synthesised) example of the
Lloyd's mirror effect as caused by an elevated moving source.

\subsubsection{Multiple reflections and shielding} % TODO don't talk about shielding?
In urban environments there are more reflecting surfaces besides the ground.
Buildings can reflect sound and shield as well. In courtyards or street canyons
multiple reflections and strong rerverberance may occur.

Sound can be considered as a ray if the wavelength of the sound is much smaller
than the characteristic lengths of the objects or geometries. % TODO: move sentence

Assuming sound can be described as a ray, a raytracer could be used to determine
the immission at a receiver position, taking into account refractions and
reflections. Raytracers are commonly used in room acoustics but also in
environmental acoustics for noise prediction.

The image source method is a computationally fast algorithm for taking into
account reflections and uses the concept of mirror sources
\cite{Allen1979,Mechel2013}. Mirror sources are found by mirroring the original
source with respect to the reflective surface that is considered. Higher-order
mirror sources can be found by repeating the process, mirroring the previous
order mirror source with respect to another surface. Care should be taken to
determine whether there is in fact line-of-sight between a mirror-source and the
receiver.

When neither source nor receiver move, the image sources have to be determined
only once, and their validity, that is, line-of-sight between image source and
receiver, needs to be checked only once as well. If instead the receiver moves,
line-of-sight will have to be checked as function of time. When both move, both
the mirror source search as well as the line-of-sight validation has to be
performed as function of time. An interesting question is how to connect image
sources at one instance in time to the image sources the next instance,
considering sources can appear and disappear over time. If only the source
moves, it may be more interesting to consider mirror receivers instead of miror
sources.

% In urban environments multiple reflections generally occur.
