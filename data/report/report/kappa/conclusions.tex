\section{Conclusions}

% TODO: comment Jens, sounds plausible

% Overview paper
Aircraft noise has a negative impact on humans. To further study its impact on
humans a tool was developed to simulate the audible sound field caused by
fly-overs of airplanes. The goal was to develop a tool that can create
auralisations of the current fleet of aircraft.

The auralisation tool consists of an emission synthesiser and a propagation
model based on geometrical acoustics. Emission synthesiser used spectral
modelling synthesis as synthesis strategy and used features extracted from
recordings as input. These features were automatically extracted from a signal
that was obtained after applying an inverse propagation model to a recording.
To verify whether the auralisations sound similar to recordings of the
respective airplane types, a listening test was conducted.

Participants were presented with a paired comparison test. Participants were
able to discriminate between sounds of different aircraft types, in case of both
recordings and auralisations. The similarity ratings between recordings and
auralisations are roughly similar to the similarity ratings between the two
aircraft type. That would imply the auralisations sound like different aircraft
than those that were recorded.

An incorrect reproduction of the blade passing frequency and its harmonics is
the likely cause of the dissimilatity between the auralisations and recordings.
The feature-extraction algorithm was tuned for the relatively small bandwidth of
the Buzz-Saw tones and is therefore underestimating the power and bandwidth of
the blade-passing frequency and harmonics.

Section \ref{sec:introduction:background:auralisation} listed several
auralisation use cases. Whether it is relevant that the auralisations do not
sound exactly similar to the recordings would depend on how the auralisations
would be utilised.

% Turbulence paper
To improve the plausibility of the auralisations
% in situations where the source-receiver distance is typically larger
a method was developed to simulate modulations due to atmospheric turbulence.
Spatial and temporal variations in temperature and cause variations in the soundspeed field.
As sound propagates through a turbulent atmosphere, the variations will cause
multiple scattering and result in audible modulations, known as scintillations.
A method was presented for generating sequences of modulations and applying
these to both monochromatic and broadband signals.

% TODO rewrite rest of section (turbulence paper)

A Rytov approximation to first-order refractive-index fluctuations results in a complex
phase which we can write as a log-amplitude $\chi$ and phase $S$ fluctuation.
The propagating sound is modelled as a time-varying channel where we consider
two sequences, one for the log-amplitude fluctuations, and another for the phase
fluctuations.

The fluctuations are frequency-dependent and therefore a filter was designed to take that into account.
% A Gaussian applied filter was used to model the atmospheric turbulence because of its simplicity and because it is computationally least demanding.
A Gaussian turbulence spectrum was considered, but the general method can be
used with other turbulence spectra as well. The Von Karman spectrum describes
real turbulence spectra typically better than the Gaussian spectrum, however,
the Von Karman spectrum is computationally much more demanding.
% The Gaussian model also allows implementing the phase fluctuation with a Variable Delay Line (VDL).

Examples are shown where the method is applied to a tone and to an aircraft
auralization. The aircraft auralization spectrogram shows several spikes
corresponding to amplitude modulations as well as an increase in the amount of
decorrelation. Furthermore the transverse velocity dependence on the frequency
content of the modulations is demonstrated.

The method seems to result in more realistic sounding
auralizations, but this has not been validated yet with listening tests. The
implementation of the model that was used in this paper to generate the figures
can be found at \cite{Rietdijk2016}.

\section{Future work}
Future steps to be taken depends strongly on how auralisations would
be used.
% The next steps to be taken depend on how auralisations would be used.

\subsubsection*{Investigate human response to aircraft sound}
If one wants to study humans' response to aircraft sound, then the next step is
to test whether auralisations of aircraft are sufficiently similar to the actual
sound of aircraft, with respect to the parameter that is being investigated. If
the conclusion is that auralisations and recordings give sufficiently similar
results, then that would imply the auralisation method can be used to further
study that aspect of human response within the domain that was considered. If
significant differences would still be found, it would have to be tested what is
causing the differences.

% TODO comment Jens
% Future work: I suggest to add some example for the reader, at "If one wants to study humansâ€™ response to aircraft sound, then the next step is to test whether auralisations of aircraft are sufficiently similar to the actual sound of aircraft, with respect to the parameter that is being investigated", like e.g. ", e.g. perceived annoyance or sleep disturbance."

\subsubsection*{Improve estimation and synthesis of blade passing frequency}
From the study that was conducted and presented in this work, it followed that
participants did indeed notice differences between the auralisations and the
recordings. A probable cause of these differences is the estimation of the
power and bandwidth of the blade passing frequency and harmonics. Therefore, a
possible improvement would be to enhance the feature-extraction algorithm to
better estimate these properties.

% The most important point to improve is likely the simulation of the
% blade passing frequency and harmonics, and that would require a better
% estimation of their powers and bandwidths. Aside from that, it would seem the
% auralisation tool is capable of delivering plausible auralisations.

\subsubsection*{Develop generic aircraft emission model}
Because the auralisations appear to sound plausible it is concluded that the strategy\todo{what strategy? recording, backprop, ...}
utilised works and therefore


\subsection{Scintillations}

\subsubsection*{Validate scintillations model}
The scintillations model is based on an existing statistical model.

\subsubsection*{Different model for describing turbulence spectrum}
As mentioned in the text the basic method for generating scintillations should
also work with other models, like the Von Karman spectrum. The Gaussian model
was chosen for performance reasons, as its simplest, but also because it allowed
further optimisations. Future work could be to develop an optimised algorithm
that utilises other spectra like e.g. the Von Karman spectrum with the use of
expressions given in \cite{Ostashev2015}.

\subsubsection*{Non-isotropic and non-homogeneous atmosphere for the scintillations model}
% \subsubsection*{Height-dependent parameters for the scintillations model}
The current model assumes a isotropic and homogeneous atmosphere. In practice,
the atmosphere is neither and parameters like the correlation length $L$ and the
variance of the refractive-index fluctuations $\langle \mu^2 \rangle$ are
height-dependent \cite{Krasnenko2013}. Ostashev et al. gave formulas for plane
\cite{Ostashev1997b} and spherical \cite{Ostashev1997c} waves propagating
through an anisotropic atmosphere and studies numerically the variances and
correlation functions of the log-amplitude and phase fluctuations
\cite{Ostashev2004}.

\subsubsection*{Determine parameters for scintillations model}
The model that was presented for generating scintillations uses a Gaussian
correlation function. A Gaussian can be used as an applied filter to get a rough
approximation to the actual turbulence spectrum within a certain wavenumber
range. An open question is how to obtain adequate values for the correlation
length $L$ and the variance of the refractive-index fluctuations $\langle \mu^2
\rangle$. Values for both can be obtained with a setup as used by Daigle et. al.
\cite{Daigle1983}, however, with such a setup values can only be obtained at
relatively low heights.
