% TODO convective amplification is a source motion effect, not propagation.
% Discuss in other section?
% Convective amplification is supported in the
% propagation model but was ignored here.

The propagation model covers sound propagation in the far field through a
homogeneous and isotropic atmosphere and takes into account geometrical
spreading, Doppler shift, atmospheric attenuation and the ground reflection.
Sound is modelled as rays and the propagation effects are implemented as signal
processing operations.

The following sections will describe each of the implemented propagation effects
in detail. To also demonstrate the different propagation effects, a fixed
situation is considered and propagation effects are added sequentially.

Figure \ref{fig:propagation_block_diagram} shows a block diagram of the steps
that are taken. Because of source motion all propagation effects are
time-variant. The order of the operation matters although some could be
exchanged. For operations that are distance-dependent, care should be taken to
consider the distance at the emission or retarded time. Divergence is computed
first. The Doppler-shift, a result of a change in propagation delay as function
of time, occurs between the source and the medium. The shifted frequencies are
then attenuated in the atmosphere. A reflection is modeled as a parallel path
with a filter representing the reflection coefficient. In case there is no
movement this filter may be considered part of the mirror source, however, as
movement is considered it needs to be placed after the Doppler-shift has been
applied.

Paper \ref{paper:turbulence} describes a model that was developed to include
scintillations, that is, fluctuations in the sound due to atmospheric
turbulence. That part is discussed in detail in Chapter \ref{chapter:turbulence}
and therefore not included in this Chapter.

% TODO explain situation - check noise signal!!
\subsection{Emission signal and scenario}
A simple emission signal is considered consisting of pink noise and several harmonic tones with a
fundamental frequency of \SI{2000}{\hertz}, both modelled as a monopole point
source at the same position. The broadband noise is the sum of 1/1-octave
band-pass filtered noise. The band-pass filters are \nth{8} order Butterworth
filters implemented as second-order sections\footnote{
Higher-order IIR filters can easily become unstable. A solution is to implement
the filter as a serial cascade of biquad or second-order sections, i.e., filters
with two poles and two zeros.}. Directivity is not included, and
there are no other signal strength variations either.

The \say{aircraft} moves at a height of \SI{200}{\meter} and with a
speed of \SI{100}{\meter\per\second} straight over the receiver.
The receiver is at a height of 1.7 meters and 8 meters next to the flight path.
Figure \ref{fig:implementation:propagation:emission} shows a spectrogram of the
emission signal. In the next sections propagation effects will be added sequentially
resulting in clear changes to the immission.

  \caption{Spectrogram of the immission. Because in this case we do not consider sound propagation this in facts corresponds to the emission of the aircraft as function of the orientation. The immission is stationary because an omni-directional source is considered and no other emission variations are modelled.}
  \label{fig:implementation:propagation:emission}
\end{figure}


\newpage
\subsection{Geometrical spreading}
Geometrical spreading causes a decrease in amplitude with distance due to
divergence and increase in propagation delay with distance due to the finite
speed of sound. Far field is assumed in which case the sound pressure at the
receiver $p_{\mathrm{rcv}}$ is given by the Green's function given in equation
\eqref{eq:theory:sound:green-free-field}. The emission signal $p_{\mathrm{src}}$
is computed at a fixed distance from the source $r_{\mathrm{src}}$. The sound
pressure at a receiver at distance $r_{\mathrm{rcv}}$ can be obtained by
rescaling the magnitude of the sound pressure of the emission signal with the
ratio of the distances
\begin{equation}
 p_{\mathrm{rcv}} = p_{\mathrm{src}} \frac{r_{\mathrm{src}}}{r_{\mathrm{rcv}}}
\end{equation}
This operation is implemented as a simple gain. Figure
\ref{fig:implementation:propagation:spreading} shows a spectrogram of the
immission when geometrical spreading is taken into account and applied to the
signal showed in Figure \ref{fig:implementation:propagation:emission}. Due to
the applied gain the sound pressure level is lower when the aircraft is farther
away, which is here at the start and the end of the sample.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[]{../figures/generated/propagation/spreading}
  \caption{Spectrogram of the immission when the amplitude decrease due to geometrical spreading is included.}
  \label{fig:implementation:propagation:spreading}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Doppler shift}
The time-dependent propagation delay, which is relevant for the Doppler shift,
is taken into account by resampling the discretized sound pressure signal with a
Variable Delay Line. Since the signal is discrete and the delay is generally not
an integer multiple of the sample time, an interpolation scheme is required.

% TODO some of it needs to go to theory
As explained in section \ref{sec:theory:signal:resampling}, multiple
interpolation schemes exist, including Lanczos interpolation that was used for
auralisation as well \cite{Rietdijk2015, Pieren2015}. In this case a linear
interpolation scheme was chosen due to its simplicity and computational
performance \cite{Heutschi2014}. While linear interpolation can cause audible
artifacts, these are in the case of a broadband signal less pronounced than if
solely a tonal component is considered as was demonstrated in Figure
\ref{fig:theory:signal-processing:resampling}.

For a given sound travel time $\Delta t(t)$ from source to receiver, the non-integer sample index
$n_{e}$ of the signal $y[n_e]$ at the source time-axis is given as
\begin{equation}
 n_{e} = n_r - \Delta t (t) \cdot f_s
\end{equation}
where $f_s$ is the fixed sampling frequency and $n_r$ the integer sample index
of the signal at the receiver time-axis. Equation
\eqref{eq:theory:signal:resampling:interpolation-linear} can then be used for
applying the Doppler shift when using $n=\floor{n_e}$ and $\eta = n_e - \floor{n_e}$
where $\floor{n_e}$ corresponds to the floor function of $n_e$.
Furthermore, an emission time should exist and therefore there is the
requirement $\floor{n_e} >= 0$.

% The received signal value $y$ at index $n_e$ is then determined by
% \begin{equation}
%  y[n_e] = \left( 1 - n_e +  \floor{n_e} \right) \cdot y \left[ \floor{n_e} \right] + \left( n_e - \floor{n_e} \right) * y \left[ \floor{n_e} + 1 \right]
% \end{equation}
% where $\floor{n_e}$ corresponds to the floor function of $n_e$.
The sound travel time was computed with the speed of sound $c =
343.2 \sqrt{ \frac{T}{T_0} }$ where $T$ is the temperature during the event and
$T_0 = 293.15$ K the reference temperature.
Figure \ref{fig:implementation:propagation:doppler} shows a spectrogram of the
immission when the propagation delay is also considered. The Doppler shift is
clearly visible, especially when considering the tonal components.
The black part in the first couple of seconds represents zero signal and is due to the initial propagation delay.

  \centering
  \includegraphics[]{../figures/generated/propagation/doppler}
  \caption{Spectrogram of the immission when the propagation delay, and thus the Doppler shift, is included as well. }
  \label{fig:implementation:propagation:doppler}
\end{figure}

\newpage
\subsection{Atmospheric attenuation} % TODO refer to theory
Atmospheric attenuation is accounted for by creating a time-variant filter of length $N_{aa}$.
A single-sided magnitude spectrum is calculated as
\begin{equation}
 \left| H_{aa} \right| = 10^{- d \alpha(f) / 20}
\end{equation}
where $d$ is the source-receiver distance in \SI{}{meter} and $\alpha(f)$ the
frequency-dependent attenuation coefficient in \SI{}{\decibel\per\meter} computed using
equation \eqref{eq:theory:sound:atmospheric-attenuation}.

% The air pressure, relative humidity, and temperature were recorded during the event.
The impulse response of a magnitude-only or zero-phase filter is non-causal and therefore in
order to create a causal filter a linear-phase filter corresponding to a 90
degrees rotation is added. The spectrum is real and even, and therefore the impulse
response is real and even as well. After convolving the signal with the designed
filter the first $N_{aa}/2$ samples were dropped to account for the delay caused
by the linear-phase factor.

Convolution was performed using a segmented convolution as explained in section
\ref{sec:theory:signal:convolution}. The filter length was 4096 samples and the
hop size 256 samples. Transitioning to the next impulse response was done
without smoothing because the difference in the impulse responses is relatively
small.

Figure \ref{fig:implementation:propagation:attenuation} shows a spectrogram of
the immission when atmospheric attenuation is included. A reference atmosphere
was considered.

  \centering
  \includegraphics[]{../figures/generated/propagation/attenuation}
  \caption{Spectrogram of the immission when atmospheric attenuation is included as well.}
  \label{fig:implementation:propagation:attenuation}
\end{figure}

\newpage
\subsection{Ground reflection} % TODO refer to theory. Extend?
While the Image Source Method was implemented with image
receivers instead of image sources, only one additional path,
a ground reflection, was considered. Therefore, the implementation of the ISM
will not be treated any further.

The ground reflection is considered as a second propagation path using a mirror receiver.
% The implementation supports direction-dependent emission signals, but because we had only one emission...
For the ground reflected path the same emission signal was used as for the
direct path, thereby ignoring directivity of the sources. The reason why the directivity of
the source is ignored will become clear in the following sections.

A filter was included to take into account the transfer funtion of the ground.
For the ground reflection the plane wave reflection coefficient was used (eq. \eqref{eq:theory:sound:reflection:plane}) and the impedance $Z$ was
calculated using Delany and Bazley's one-parameter model (eq. \eqref{eq:theory:sound:impedance:db}).

Because aircraft are mostly overhead and at larger distances,
using the plane wave reflection coefficient should typically be sufficient.
However, when simulating noise sources at low elevation angles, the plane-wave
assumption is no longer valid and must be replaced by a model that takes into
account the reflection of spherical waves from a ground surface of finite
impedance \cite{Tuttle2014}. % TODO rewrite. Maybe move to theory

The scenarios considered were landings. Because the area around the airport
consists mostly of grass a flow resistivity of
\SI{2e5}{\pascal\second\per\meter\squared} was chosen. The filter length was
4096 samples and the hop size 256 samples.

Figure \ref{fig:implementation:propagation:reflection} shows a spectrogram of
the immission when a reflection on a hard ground was added. The additional path
clearly causes interference as can be seen from the bands in the Figure.
The effect of a hard and soft ground was demonstrated before in Figure \ref{fig:theory:sound:reflection:ground}.

\subsection{Concluding remarks}
This section gave an overview of the propagation model that was implemented in
the auralisation tool. The propagation effects that were considered were
implemented as signal processing operations. The model that was implemented
could now be used to investigate how properties of the atmosphere, boundaries
and the geometry, affect sound propagation.

After taking into account sound propagation an immission signal is obtained that
already starts to sound like an aircraft. However, thus far a simple emission
signal consisting of some noise and several tones was considered. The next
section presents a method to obtain a more accurate airplane emission signal.

% \subsection{Time delay and Doppler shift}
%
% The limited speed of sound causes a delay between receiving and emitting a signal.
% A common method to include this delay in a real-time implementation is to use a variable-delay line.   % Needs reference
% % This implementation is not real-time, resulting in more available options.
%
% % The time delay can be simulated using a variable delay line.
%
% Since the signal is discrete and the delay is generally not an integer multiple of the sample time, an interpolation scheme is required.
%
% \subsubsection{Linear interpolation}
% Initially, linear interpolation was used.
% For a given sound travel time $\Delta t(t)$ from source to receiver, the index
% $k_{r}^{'}$ is given as
% \begin{equation}
%  k_{r}^{'} = k_e + \Delta t (t) \cdot f_s
% \end{equation}
% where $f_s$ is the sampling frequency.
% ......
%
% Figure \ref{} shows an example where linear interpolation was used to apply a Doppler shift.
%
% \missingfigure{Spectrogram of a Doppler shifted tonal component. The Doppler shift was applied by resampling the signal and using linear interpolation.}
%
% The Doppler shifted tonal component is clearly visible, however, strong artefacts are also visible and indeed audible.
% In practice, these artifacts are often masked by noise components but this however cannot be guaranteed.
%
% There are methods to reduce these artefacts. For example, upsampling the signal before resampling decreases the prominence of the artifacts.
% Another possibility is a different interpolation scheme.
%
% \subsubsection{Lanczos interpolation}
% Theoretically, the optimal reconstruction filter is a sinc filter. In practice
% only approximations of this filter can be used, and these approximations are
% generally achieved by windowing and truncating the sinc function. One of these
% approximations is the Lanczos filter or kernel, which is the sinc function
% windowed by another sinc function.
%
% The Lanczos kernel is given by
% \begin{equation}
%  L(z) = \begin{cases}
%          \textrm{sinc}(z) \textrm{sinc}(z/a), & \textrm{if} -a < z < a \\
%          0, & \text{otherwise}
%         \end{cases}
% \end{equation}
% where $a$ is the size of the kernel. Consider now a signal with samples $s_i$
% for integer values of $i$ where sample $s_i$ corresponds to the sample at $t=i/f_s$.
% The value at retarded time $t'$ is then given by
% \begin{equation}
%  S(x) = \sum_{\floor{x} - a + 1}^{\floor{x} + a} s_i L(x-i)
% \end{equation}
% where $x$ is the sample at retarded time $t'$
% \begin{equation}
%  x = -t' + i
% \end{equation}
% The frequency shift depends on the change of propagation delay. Therefore, when source and receiver are relatively close to one another, the method is most sensitive to uncertainties in source position and speed of sound.

% \subsection{Atmospheric attenuation}
% The atmospheric attenuation coefficient $\alpha$ in dB/km is calculated according to ISO 9613-1 \cite{ISO9613-1} as presented in \ref{sec:theory_sound_atmospheric_attenuation}.
%
% A single-sided spectrum is calculated as
% % Equation \ref{} is sampled to obtain an attenuation spectrum in dB/m and then multiplied with the current distance to obtain the actual attenuation.
% \begin{equation}
%  10.0^{- d \alpha(f) / 20}
% \end{equation}
% The spectrum is real and even, and therefore the impulse response is real and even as well. A non-causal zero-phase filter was designed.
%
%
%
% The attenuation spectrum is converted to an impulse response using the IFFT.
% Because the attenuation is distance-dependent and the distance changes over time, the impulse response needs to be updated.
%
% The attenuation is applied by performing a convolution between the impulse responses and the input signal.
% The convolution is done by multiplying a matrix consisting of impulse responses with a vector representing the input signal.
% The impulse responses are stored in a sparse matrix to reduce memory consumption.
% Nevertheless, because of computational limitations, the impulse response describing atmospheric attenuation are determined for an $N$ amount unique distances.
%
% Since atmospheric absorption is frequency-dependent, care should be taken that
% one corrects for the Doppler shift first. Since a moving medium (due to wind) is not
% included in the propagation model, the time delay between source and receiver
% can be calculated directly, and the atmospheric absorption applied thereafter.
%
% \missingfigure{Spectrogram of auralisation}
%
% %
% % The attenuation coefficient for
% % pure tones $\alpha$ is calculated according to ISO 9613-1 \cite{ISO9613-1} in
% % the frequency domain. This attenuation, corresponding to a (single-sided) power spectrum in decibels, is converted to a double-sided amplitude spectrum
% % using
% % \begin{alignat}{2}
% %  a_{\alpha}[k] &= 10^{+ d \alpha}, && \quad 0 \leq k \leq N/2 \\
% %  a_{\alpha}[-k] &= a_{\alpha}[k], && \quad 1 \leq k \leq N/2-1
% % \end{alignat}
% % where $M$ is the amount of desired filter taps, $k$ the block index of discrete frequency $f_k$ and $d$ the source-receiver distance.
% % Note also the plus sign; in case of an auralization this sign would be negative but now we're interested in an amplification.
% % An impulse response is obtained by taking the IFFT of $M$ blocks. The small imaginary parts are discarded by taking the real part.
% % The filter is then made causal by rotating the impulse response with $M/2$ samples. A rectangular window was used.
% %
% % The attenuation is range-dependent and because of the aircraft movement the range varies with time. Within one recording there is a
% % maximum and minimum range. An $N$ amount of impulse responses are determined for
% % an $N$ amount of equispaced ranges.
% %
% % The attenuation is applied by performing a convolution between the impulse
% % responses and the input signal. The convolution is done in a rather naive way by multiplying a
% % Toeplitz matrix consisting of impulse responses with a vector representing the input
% % signal. The impulse responses are stored as a sparse array to reduce memory
% % consumption. No further operations were done regarding the impulse response transitions.
