\section{Overview}

In this part the implementation is discussed.

... as written in Paper \ref{paper:overview}.

As explained in the introduction, we would like to develop an auralization tool that is physically as correct as possible.

The assumption is made that source and propagation can be 
described independently of each other.

\begin{tikzpicture}[auto, node distance=1cm,>=latex']
\tikzset{
block/.style    = {draw, shape=rectangle, fill=white, minimum height=4em, minimum width=5em, text width=5em, align=center},
}
    % Main nodes
    \node [block]                       (emission)      {Emission};
    \node [block, right=of emission]    (propagation)     {Propagation};
    \node [block, right=of propagation]   (immission)         {Immission};

    % Main edges
    \draw [->]  (emission)      --  (propagation);
    \draw [->]  (propagation)   --  (immission);

\end{tikzpicture}

The tools mentioned in \ref{sec:theory:auralisation:software} as well as other
general-purpose languages were considered for the implemention.
% TODO further motivation

The auralisation tool was implemented mostly in Python 3.5 \cite{Python} and
Cython \cite{Behnel2011,Cython}. Extensive use was made of the
Numpy\cite{VanderWalt2011,Numpy}, Scipy\cite{Scipy} and
Pandas\cite{Mckinney2010} libraries. A full implementation of the tool can be
found at \cite{Rietdijk2017d}.
