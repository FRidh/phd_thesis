\chapter{Subjective validation of synthesis method}\label{chapter:test}\todo{From paper. Rewrite}

\section{Introduction}
In the previous chapter an overview was given of the auralisation tool. A
propagation model for aircraft sound was developed but still missing is an
emission model. An algorithm was presented for extracting select features from
recordings with the underlying idea of using those features for the development
of an empirical emission model.

This chapter describes a listening test that was conducted and as written also in
Paper \ref{paper:overview}. The purpose of the listening test was to check the
plausiblity or perceptual validity of the auralisations and a comparison was
therefore made between recordings and auralisations.

% TODO maybe drop this part?
How sounds are perceived can depend on many factors. Factors can be properties
of the sound, but also of the listener or the environment. Psychoacoustic
measures describe how a sound is perceived by most listeners and can therefore
be used to characterise a sound. Many measures exist, but not all measures are
appliceable to all sounds and care should therefore be taken when choosing
measures. Examples of common measures are loudness, roughness and sharpness.
Due to time-constraints psychoacoustic measures were not measured. Instead, the
overall similarity between stimuli was determined.

\section{Method} % This section has been rewritten...slightly.

The goal of the listening test was to determine whether the auralisations sound
similar to the recordings they were based on. Participants were presented with
pairs of stimuli and asked to rate how similar they sounded.

% \todo{explain why this method is chosen? Explain other available methods?}
% One can think of multiple methods to
% determine the similarity. The MUSHRA (MUltiple Stimuli with Hidden Reference and
% Anchor) test is methodology used for evaluating audio quality \cite{}, and has also been used for determining the plausibility of synthesised vehicle pass-by sounds when compared to recordings \cite{Southern2016}.

Eight different sounds were considered and they were each 12 seconds long. The
sounds include the approach of an aircraft, its flyover and its distancing.
Because the character of the sounds varies considerably over time, they were
each split into parts of four seconds, corresponding to the approach, fly-over
and distancing. The listening test was also divided in these three parts. First,
participants were presented to all approach stimuli, then all fly-over stimuli
and finally all distancing stimuli. In each test part all stimuli combinations
were considered. Therefore, each part consisted of 28 pairs of stimuli of four
seconds.

Of the eight sounds four were recordings, and four were auralisations. Each
auralisation was based on one of the recordings. Two aircraft types were
considered, an A320 and a RJ1H, as well as two events per aircraft type.
% The recordings were made close to the airport. \todo{this sentence can be dropped if we have a Measurements section}
% with the aircraft passing by at approximately 90 meters.
Fade in and fade out was applied to the stimuli. Headphones were used with a
single channel. Head-related transfer functions were not included.

Similarity is relative, and therefore an anchor is typically used. For each
part, participants were first given the set of stimuli, in order to become
familiar with the type of sounds and the spread in the sounds of that part, and
then continued with rating the pairs. The rating was done on an eleven point
Likert scale. The left side of the scale said ``not so much'' and the right side
``very much''. The scale was not numbered. The order of the stimuli was
randomised for each test.

Figures \ref{fig:listening:recording-A320} and
\ref{fig:listening:simulation-A320} show spectrograms of some of the stimuli
that were used. The blade passing frequency and harmonics are not as prominent
in the auralisation as they are in the recording.

\section{Results}
The results of the participants were scaled linearly from 0 to 1 with 0
corresponding to ``not so much'' and 1 corresponding to ``very much''. Not all
of the participants used the entire scale, and therefore they were rescaled per
participant and per test part to use the full scale. There were 17 participants,
all graduate students, and of which the majority studied acoustics. The results
that are shown are obtained after joining the data of all participants and all
three test parts.

Figure \ref{fig:ratings_recordings} shows the similarity ratings grouped per
aircraft combination, considering only recordings. Figure
\ref{fig:ratings_simulations} shows the similarity ratings grouped per aircraft
combination, but now for the auralisations. Figures \ref{fig:ratings_A320} and
\ref{fig:ratings_RJ1H} show for respectively the A320 and the RJ1H the
similarity ratings grouped per pairs of stimuli type, that is, recordings and/or
simulations. The listening test and results can be found at respectively
\cite{Rietdijk2017a} and \cite{Rietdijk2017b}.

The ratings were obtained for three different parts of the stimuli, ``start'',
``center'' and ``end'', and that allows us to also group the ratings by each of
these parts. Figures \ref{fig:ratings_part_A320} and \ref{fig:ratings_part_RJ1H}
show the similarity ratings for respectively the A320 and RJ1H grouped per
stimuli type combination and per stimuli part. A Tukey boxplot is used to
improve the clarity of the figure.

Participants mentioned they noted larger differences at especially the beginning
of the events (``start`` parts) and also at the end of the events (``end`` parts). A
common answer to the question how many aircraft they heard was ``two or three``.
Occasionally, the answer would start at ``two`` but go to ``two or more`` after they
were told they were listening to not only recordings but also simulations. Some
participants were surprised when told that simulations were included,
others said they had thought so, and a few of the participants were already
aware the test was possibly going to contain simulations.

\section{Discussion}
As can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:ratings_recordings}, the A320's are judged to be very
similar to each other, and the RJ1H's as quite similar to each other. The A320's
are not rated as very similar to the RJ1H's and therefore we conclude that the
participants can discriminate between the two aircraft types.

In the case of the auralisations, Figure \ref{fig:ratings_simulations}, the
participants can also discriminate between the aircraft types, but now the
RJ1H's are judged to be relatively more similar than the A320's. Compared to the recordings
the difference between the A320's and the RJ1H's is slightly smaller.

% One might argue from these findings that the whole set of auralisations is more similar than the set of recordings.

Figures \ref{fig:ratings_A320} and \ref{fig:ratings_RJ1H} show
as additional information how similar the auralisations are to the recordings.
The groups ``(rec, sim)'' contain pairs consisting of a recording and an
auralisation. The similarity ratings for these two groups are similar to the
``(A320, RJ1H)'' groups in Figures \ref{fig:ratings_recordings} and
\ref{fig:ratings_simulations}. Therefore, it would appear that listeners can
discriminate between aircraft types, but that the auralisations are considered
to be of different aircraft types than the recordings they're based on.

Figures \ref{fig:ratings_part_A320} and \ref{fig:ratings_part_RJ1H} show the
same data but now further grouped by stimuli part. Judging from Figure
\ref{fig:ratings_part_A320} there appears to be a relative large dissimilarity
between the ``start'' parts of the A320 recordings and also between the ``end''
parts of the A320 auralisations. The groups ``(rec, rec)'' and ``(sim, sim)''
consist however of only 17 data points each whereas the ``(rec, sim)'' group
has 68 data points.

The participants mentioned relatively larger differences in the stimuli that
correspond to the approach of the aircraft (``start`` stimuli). During the
approach the tonal components are clearly audible compared to other parts of the
events due to the directivity. The feature-extraction algorithm was known to
underestimate the power and bandwidth of the blade passing frequency and its
harmonics because the algorithm was tuned for the Buzz-Saw tones. Therefore, a
likely explanation is that this underestimation of power and bandwidth is
causing audible differences between recordings and auralisations.
