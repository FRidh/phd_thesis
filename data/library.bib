abstract = {In order to minimize the duration of acoustic measurements and to characterize homogeneous areas from a temporal point of view, a series of six location measurements was carried out continuously during three months in Paris. Around fifty thousand samples of 5-min, 10-min, 15-min, 20-min, 30-min, and 1-h duration measurements were extracted for each location. Each sample is characterized by eleven energy indicators and ten event descriptors. In this paper, analysis of a crossroad location is detailed. Through hierarchical ascendant classification and artificial neural networks classification, it is shown that four homogeneous periods can be detected: two during the night, one during the day, and one transition corresponding either to the awakening or to the moment when the city falls asleep. 10-min measurements are necessary to discriminate these time periods at the crossroad location. At the end of the paper, a comparison with the other locations shows that minimum duration states in between 10 and 20 min. The homogeneous periods are connected to the human activities and depend on the location. Energy indicators such as LAeq, LA10, or LA90 and event indicators are necessary to characterize the different clusters.},

abstract = {In the framework of the European Directive 2002-49-EU, the medium sized cities of Volos and Larissa in central Greece recently completed (2012) their strategic noise maps and relevant action plans that define the main strategies to reduce noise exposure of residents and introduce and preserve "quite zones". For the first time in this framework, it has been decided to introduce, as well, a general study for five specific urban districts covering not only the measurement and modeling of environmental noise levels but also qualitative surveys on the sound perception by the residents and several analyses of the urban and architectural tissue. The districts (respectively four in Volos and one in Larissa with the two of them in the center of both agglomerations) were chosen as representatives of urban situations due to their proximity to transportation infrastructures (main road network, industrial harbor facilities and both regional and intercity train network) and also because they represent different urban typologies (residential district, downtown area with or without shops, more or less densely populated neighborhood, etc.{\ldots}). Sociological surveys on sound and noise perception have been implemented on some 15{\%} of the residents per district using opened questionnaires. Soundscape analysis was also conducted through qualitative criteria. A cross-analysis of these data explains in detail the physical reasons for the existence of sound qualities that contribute to the identity of each distinct neighborhood. This paper, in a strategic plan level, has introduced valuable recommendations in order not only to preserve the sound quality on the existing sites but also to authorize developers and decision makers (mayors, architects, town planners) to evolve them positively over time.},

abstract = {Greenery on buildings is being consolidated as an interesting way to improve the quality of life in urban environments. Among the benefits that are associated with greenery systems for buildings, such as energy savings, biodiversity support, and storm-water control, there is also noise attenuation. Despite the fact that green walls are one of the most promising building greenery systems, few studies of their sound insulation potential have been conducted. In addition, there are different types of green walls; therefore, available data for this purpose are not only sparse but also scattered. To gather knowledge about the contribution of vertical greenery systems to noise reduction, especially a modular-based green wall, two different standardised laboratory tests were conducted. The main results were a weighted sound reduction index (Rw) of 15dB and a weighted sound absorption coefficient ($\alpha$) of 0.40. It could be concluded that green walls have significant potential as a sound insulation tool for buildings but that some design adjustments should be performed, such as improving the efficiency of sealing the joints between the modular pieces.},

abstract = {This research has developed a systematic aircraft noise charge scheme, based on noise social costs, with a view to its application in Taiwan. The paper starts with a brief review of current structures and applications of noise charges, a market-based measure, in mitigating aircraft noise worldwide. The evaluation of aircraft noise social cost is an attempt at putting noise nuisance into monetary terms. The total and average noise social cost per flight at one airport is clearly different from another, depending mainly on the size of the noise contour and the number of residents affected. This research estimates the average noise social costs at various airports, using nine Taiwanese airports as case studies. Depending on the marginal impact of a flight and the mixture of aircraft types at each airport, the noise social cost per landing and take-off is then estimated for different aircraft types. The results of this study can inform airport, airline and local administration policies for taking environmental concerns into account when setting up noise charges, revising noise insulation schemes, and developing strategies for airport expansion and airline operations.},

abstract = {In a survey of 2,312 residents living near Frankfurt Airport aircraft noise annoyance and disturbances as well as environmental (EQoL) and health-related quality of life (HQoL) were assessed and compared with data on exposure due to aircraft, road traffic, and railway noise. Results indicate higher noise annoyance than predicted from general exposure-response curves. Beside aircraft sound levels source-related attitudes were associated with reactions to aircraft noise. Furthermore, aircraft noise affected EQoL in general, although to a much smaller extent. HQoL was associated with aircraft noise annoyance, noise sensitivity and partly with aircraft noise exposure, in particular in the subgroup of multimorbid residents. The results suggest a recursive relationship between noise and health, yet this cannot be tested in cross-sectional studies. Longitudinal studies would be recommendable to get more insight in the causal paths underlying the noise-health relationship.},

abstract = {This paper is an outcome of a workshop that addressed the question how soundscape research can improve its impact on the local level. It addresses a number of topics by complementing existing approaches and practices with possible future approaches and practices. The paper starts with an analysis of the role of sound annoyance and suboptimal soundscapes on the lives of individuals and concludes that a good soundscape, or more generally a good sensescape, is at the same time pleasant as well as conducive for the adoption of healthy habits. To maintain or improve sensescape quality, urban planning needs improved design tools that allow for a more holistic optimization and an active role of the local stakeholders. Associated with this is a gradual development from government to governance in which optimization of the soundscape at a local (administrative or geographic) level is directly influenced by the users of spaces. The paper concludes that soundscape research can have a greater impact by helping urban planners design for health and pleasant experiences as well as developing tools for improved citizen involvement in local optimization.},

abstract = {Traditionally aircraft flyover noise is assessed by displaying contours of noise metrics. These models can be used to study noise mitigation measures but they lack the possibility to play-back the audible sound as predicted by their calculations. To that end, noise synthesis is an option that allows to experience differences due to noise abatement procedures or new aircraft designs. A noise synthesis technique for aircraft noise is demonstrated by predicting the noise at a noise monitoring location near an airport. By comparing the synthesized results to a recorded measurement, an indication on the capability of this technique has been acquired. Differences between the synthesized and measured sound remain. A large part of that difference is believed to be caused by the inherent uncertainty when using predictive empirical source noise models. It is shown that differences between departure routes can be captured, thereby illustrating the potential of this method to listen to different take-off procedures. Future improvements in source noise prediction and the inclusion of the effects of turbulence on propagation will further aid to the realism of synthesized aircraft noise.},

abstract = {Aircraft noise pollution is a common challenge faced by the world. In China, this problem has drawn more and more attention from the local government and general public, as the average growth of aviation capacity exceeds 10{\%} every year. Therefore this review paper aims to investigate the characteristics of China's aircraft noise, the underlying reasons for noise complaints, and the negative impacts of aircraft noise on human health. It is found that there is an increase, on average, of 3{\%} hearing loss per exposure year in China. Aircraft noise can also bring potential damages to other physiological systems, such as the cardiovascular system. Along with the fast development of the aviation industry, complaints arising due to the disturbance of aircraft noise have occurred more frequently in China. For the residents living in the vicinity of the airport, aircraft noise can induce their annoyance at different levels, and it has been revealed that the areas and populations influenced by aircraft noise are predicted to grow steadily with the flight increase and airport expansion. Comparatively, Chinese residents might be more easily annoyed by aircraft noise. The differences among typical international aircraft noise standards and regulations, and the existing problems are also summarised. Finally this paper further explores the appropriate strategies for the reduction of aircraft noise, as well as the preventative legislation for the future.},

Results from a panel study conducted in conjunction with the relocation of Norway's main airport in 1998 are presented. One recreational area was studied at each airport site. The samples (n = 1,264/1,370) were telephone interviewed about their use of the area before and after the change. Results indicate that changed aircraft noise exposure may influence individual choices to use local outdoor recreational areas, suggesting that careful considerations are needed in the planning of air routes over local outdoor recreational areas. However, considerable stability in use, and also fluctuations in use unrelated to the changes in noise conditions were found. Future studies of noise impacts should examine a broader set of coping mechanisms, like intra- and temporal displacement. Also, the role of place attachment, and the substitutability of local areas should be studied.},

abstract = {In order to apply noise mapping to traffic noise prediction, a knowledge of several information about traffic characteristics is required to predict the noise levels emitted by the roads involved. In the European case, the CNOSSOS-EU calculation method for traffic-noise level prediction is now under discussion, to be agreed in response to the European Directive relating to the Assessment and Management of Environmental Noise (2002/49/EC). In this application context, standard ISO 1996-2:2007 Determination of Environmental Noise Levels, in its Section 6.2, specifically mentions that during Leq measurements of road traffic noise the number of vehicle pass-bys shall be counted during the measurement time interval. This information is often not available in many roads, so it is typically registered by means of casual counts, often through manual procedures. Besides, if the measurement result is converted to other traffic conditions, a categorization of the vehicles involved is also required. Some additional information, such as the traffic density and the average speed, should be registered if a calculation method is used to build a noise map. In this paper a new automatic classification system of traffic noise covering these requirements is presented. The portable system processes a two channel audio recording to provide information of the average speed and the number of vehicles, which are classified in six categories during the measurement period. After several evaluations of the possibilities to get a good classification of the noise emission of a road from audio recordings, it is shown that increasing the within-class separation, as well as introducing a novel BSS–PCA-based classifier, the precision achieved in the final results is substantially improved.},

abstract = {Noise from road traffic propagates to acoustically shielded areas as roadside courtyard by multiple reflection and diffraction paths in a complex three-dimensional (3D) environment. The computation of noise levels and assessment of candidate noise mitigation measures for these areas has up to now been based upon two-dimensional (2D) geometrical assumptions. Here, a recently developed efficient wave-based method, the extended Fourier pseudospectral time-domain (PSTD) method, is used to investigate the necessity of a 3D model. For frequencies up to 500 Hz and low traffic velocities of 30 km/h and 50 km/h, a road traffic noise configuration of an urban street canyon with or without cross streets and a closed roadside courtyard is compared to the 2D configuration as studied previously. It can be concluded that the contribution of distant sources is overpredicted by the 2D configuration. As noise mitigation measures, additional fa{\c{c}}ade absorption, fa{\c{c}}ade screens and roof screens have been studied. Results show that the 2D configuration underpredicts the effect of fa{\c{c}}ade mitigation measures, by maximum 1.5 dB(A) for the absorption case and 4.4 dB(A) for the screens case. The effect of roof screens is overpredicted up to 1.7 dB(A). Given these deviations and the found deviations between the 3D configurations of street canyon with and without cross streets, the need for a 3D model can be concluded to be strongly configuration dependent. The 3D model is finally used to investigate the effect of a fa{\c{c}}ade opening to the courtyard, which could lead to up to 10 dB(A) higher noise levels as compared to the noise propagating over the roof level and may prohibit the use of these courtyards as quiet areas. Absorption in the fa{\c{c}}ade opening can significantly limit this negative effect.},

abstract = {The present study analyses the effects of the physical characteristics of the visual landscape on soundscape perception in city parks, based on information gathered in field surveys using a specifically designed soundwalk method in five city parks in China. Three soundscape parameters were conceived, including perceived loudness of individual sounds (PLS), perceived occurrences of individual sounds (POS) and soundscape diversity index (SDI), which were found to correlate and should thus be applied in concert. Physical characteristics of the visual landscape were analysed from two perspectives, i.e., by on-site landscape composition and local landscape spatial patterns. The results suggest that the percentage of buildings, vegetation and sky in panoramic views (here photos) were effective landscape elements influencing soundscape perception. The landscape shape index of buildings and water areas (LSI{\_}B, LSI{\_}W) and the patch cohesion index of water areas (COHESION{\_}W) showed positive effects on the perception of human sounds. The percentage of roads (PLAND{\_}R) and the largest patch index of roads (LPI{\_}R) were related to traffic sounds. Both the PLS and POS of biological sounds were negatively related to LPI{\_}W and LSI{\_}B, respectively, whilst the POS of biological sounds was positively related to PLAND{\_}R, and LSI{\_}R. COHESION{\_}R was the only index negatively related to both the PLS and POS of geophysical sounds. SDI only showed positive relationship with PLAND{\_}W. Overall, the results reveal that local landscape spatial patterns could be more influential on soundscape perception than on-site landscape composition. The study proposed introducing soundscape information from different sources into landscape management.},

abstract = {Surveys show that inhabitants of dwellings exposed to high noise levels benefit from having access to a quiet side. However, current practice in noise prediction often underestimates the noise levels at a shielded fa{\c{c}}ade.
Multiple reflections between fa{\c{c}}ades in street canyons and inner yards are commonly neglected and fa{\c{c}}ades are
approximated as perfectly flat surfaces yielding only specular reflection. In addition, sources at distances much larger than normally taken into account in noise maps might still contribute significantly. Since one of the main reasons for this is computational burden, an efficient engineering model for the diffraction of the sound over the
roof tops is proposed, which considers multiple reflections, variation in building height, canyon width, fa{\c{c}}ade roughness and different roof shapes. The model is fitted on an extensive set of full-wave numerical calculations of canyon-to-canyon sound propagation with configurations matching the distribution of streets and building
geometries in a typical historically grown European city. This model allows calculating the background noise in the shielded areas of a city, which could then efficiently be used to improve existing noise mapping calculations.
The model was validated by comparison to long-term measurements at 9 building fa{\c{c}}ades whereof 3 were at
inner yards in the city of Ghent, Belgium. At shielded fa{\c{c}}ades, a strong improvement in prediction accuracy is obtained.},

abstract = {The “Galileo Galilei” airport is a civil and military airport quite close to central Pisa. Although the airport brings benefits in terms of tourism and different types of income, the air traffic growth exacerbates the exposition to aircraft noise. This could significantly affect public health. To this day, a small number of studies takes into account the standard indicators of Europe by considering noise emission data for military aircrafts. We estimated the noise impact produced by the airport and we evaluated the related exposed population by using the Integrated Noise Model (INM). The noise power levels of both commercial and military flights have been considered as an input to the model. Predicted levels were validated by means of a noise-monitoring network. A new tracking system (AirNav Radar) that captures Automatic Identification System (AIS) signals emitted by each aircraft has been used to emulate takeoff and landing procedures. This improves the accuracy of the input to the model. We simulated noise maps for present and future scenarios, including those following the application of noise reduction measures. For each situation, we also estimated the exposure of the population and the percentages of highly annoyed and highly sleep disturbed people. We show the utility of AIS data and their specific elaboration to draw up noise abatement measures in order to reduce the noise impact on population and allow the airport development.},

Due to economical constraints a priority scale of mitigation actions is needed and, for this purpose, the Italian legislation established a methodology based on the exceeding of the limits and the amount of population exposed to such exceeding. This paper proposes a new method, named Multi Annoyance Building Prioritisation Score (MABPS), aimed to take into account the annoyance due to the exposure from different sources (multiexposure). The proposed method is a modification of the Scottish Building Prioritisation Score (BPS), shortly described in the paper too. To test the MABPS method, the case study of strategic noise map of Pisa was considered. All the noise levels from airport, roads, railways and industries were calculated and limits and advantages of the method are discussed by comparing the MABPS index with the Italian and Scottish ones, also in the perspective of a standardized procedure. The results show significant differences between MABPS and the other methods, especially because the former considers a larger number of buildings to be included into the action plan and, at this stage, no weightings are applied to take account of the building use.},

One way to achieve this goal is to add or accentuate sounds that are considered to be desired by most users of the space, such that the desired sounds mask undesired sounds, or at least distract attention away from undesired sounds. In view of removing the need for a listening panel to assess the effectiveness of such soundscape measures, the interest for new models and techniques is growing. In this paper, a model of auditory attention to environmental sound is presented, which balances computational complexity and biological plausibility. Once the model is trained for a particular location, it classifies the sounds that are present in the soundscape and simulates how a typical listener would switch attention over time between different sounds. The model provides an acoustic summary, giving the soundscape designer a quick overview of the typical sounds at a particular location, and allows assessment of the perceptual effect of introducing additional sounds.},

abstract = {Sound propagation over intensive and extensive green roofs was numerically studied by using the finite-difference time-domain method. The Zwikker and Kosten model was used to simulate sound propagation in the substrate layer itself. The presence of a green roof is mainly interesting in a street canyon configuration, and fits well in the concept of quiet sides. Positive effects of green roofs, relative to fully rigid roofs, are mainly observed at the octave bands with centre frequencies 500 and 1000Hz. The source type was shown to be unimportant when considering this particular parameter. There is a linear relationship between the fraction of the roof covered with green and the decrease in sound pressure level at the non-exposed canyon. The slopes increase with octave band centre frequency. The width–height ratio of the street canyon configuration has only a limited effect. For extensive green roofs, a pronounced attenuation peak is found when varying the layer thickness, leading to a maximum reduction of up to 10dB, relative to an acoustically rigid roof, for the octave band of 1000Hz. A good overall efficiency is observed near the maximum layer thickness (15–20cm) for this type of green roof. For an intensive green roof with a substrate layer thickness exceeding 20cm, which is common, positive effects are not influenced anymore by substrate thickness.},

abstract = {Noise dose as a sole independent variable accounts only for less than half of the variance in community response data. Non-acoustic factors, such as attitude to the noise source identified by Job [(1988). J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 83(3), 991-1001] and others, reduce the unexplained variance. This paper suggests that non-acoustic factors reflect the context in which the sonic environment is perceived; hence, these factors constitute the judgments of a soundscape. Fidell et al. [(2011). J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 130(2), 791-806] show that a "community tolerance level" (CTL) is a one-number, community-specific, independent variable that represents the aggregate influence on annoyance judgments of all non-acoustic influences. Taken together these findings suggest that: (i) CTL is a one-number quantification of a soundscape, and (ii) a soundscape can be quantified by a single, numeric variable. It follows, if one can predict or calculate the single numeric quantification of a soundscape, that number will be the CTL. These results can only be true for a soundscape judged on the basis of annoyance. Virtually no data exist for which the respondents even had the possibility to rate the sonic environment positively, i.e., pleasing, so the application of CTL to soundscapes judged positively is not clear.},

abstract = {Solutions to the partial differential equations that describe acoustic problems can be found by analytical,
numerical and experimental techniques. Within arbitrary domains and for arbitrary initial and
boundary conditions, all solution techniques require certain assumptions and simplifications. Mostly,
it is difficult to estimate the precision of a solution technique. Due to the lack of a standardised
process to quantify and report the performance of the solution technique, a variety of ways exists
to discuss the results with the scientific community. Moreover, the absence of general reference results
does hamper the development of validating newly developed techniques. Over the years, many
researchers in the field of computational acoustics have therefore expressed the need and wish to
have available common benchmark cases. This contribution is intended to be the start of a long term
project, about creating benchmarks in the entire field of computational acoustics within the EAA
community. A framework of classifying acoustic benchmark cases is suggested and as a first step,
this paper is limited to the class of linear acoustic cases. Within these cases, different categories
are defined as eigenvalue problems, time–domain problems and time–harmonic problems. Among the
other categories to be distinguished within the linear cases are interior and exterior problems, 2d and
3d problems, and problems with scattering or radiating boundary conditions. Furthermore, a way of
reporting on the used solution technique (as the number of operations, memory requirements and
accessibility of the numerical code) and on reporting the results for the selected benchmark case, is
suggested. Three problems have been defined and they will demonstrate how the benchmark cases
are intended to be used.},

abstract = {Exposure-response relationships are important tools for policy makers to assess the impact of an environmental stressor on the populace. Their validity lies partly in their statistical strength which is greatly influenced by the size of the sample from which the relationship is derived. As such, the derivation of meaningful exposure-response relationships requires estimates of vibration exposure at a large number of receiver locations. In the United Kingdom a socio-vibrational survey has been conducted with the aim of deriving exposure-response relationships for annoyance due to vibration from (a) railway traffic and (b) the construction of a new light rail system. Response to vibration was measured via a questionnaire conducted face-to-face with residents in their own homes and vibration exposure was estimated using data from a novel measurement methodology. In total, 1281 questionnaires were conducted: 931 for vibration from railway traffic and 350 for vibration from construction sources. Considering the interdisciplinary nature of this work along with the volume of experimental data required, a number of significant technical and logistical challenges needed to be overcome through the planning and implementation of the fieldwork. Four of these challenges are considered in this paper: the site identification for providing a robust sample of the residents affected, the strategies used for measuring both exposure and response and the coordination between the teams carrying out the social survey and the vibration measurements.},

abstract = {A numerical comparison is made between the road traffic noise shielding provided by 4-m high vertically erected walls and (earth) berms, averaged over large zones behind them. A previously developed and validated full-wave numerical sound propagation model was used. In absence of wind, a noise screen is preferred when it can be placed at the same position as the foot of the berm at the source side. In case of a fixed top position for both the wall and berm, an acoustically soft berm with a flat top gives similar shielding as the wall. In case of downwind sound propagation (i.e. a worst-case situation), the noise wall efficiency largely decreases. Strong wind might lead to an almost complete loss of noise wall shielding when compared to sound propagation over unobstructed terrain in absence of wind. In contrast, with decreasing berm slope angle, downward refraction by wind can become very small. In case of berms with a slope of 1:3, or berms with steeper slopes but with a flat top, the averaged wind effect can be smaller than 1dBA because of the limited magnitude of vertical gradients in the horizontal component of the wind speed near such more streamlined obstacles. When looking at long-term equivalent noise levels, including periods with wind, acoustically soft and shallow berms should be chosen upon vertically erected noise walls. In addition, there are clear non-acoustical benefits associated with the use of such natural berms. Wind-breaking vegetation has not been considered in this study.},

First, as speed-density relation is used to estimate the traffic volume from GPS data collected from floating cars. Meanwhile, the attributes of the roads and buildings are automatically exported from GIS. Second, a single vehicle noise emission model is combined with a noise propagation model to formulate a regional traffic noise calculation model that accounts for the traffic noise attenuation in an urban area. The algorithm is optimized by intelligently dividing the computational grids, filtering the traffic noise sources automatically and performing a quick index of the estimation objects. Finally, the day and night road traffic noise levels in Guangzhou are estimated to create two traffic noise maps. The accuracy of the developed algorithm is validated by conducting a traffic noise monitoring experiment in several districts of Guangzhou with different road types. The results show that the average error between the estimated and measured values is below 2.0dB.},

Today, in many patsy of the world the benefits of accessibility are taken for granted and traffic is perceived as having a negative impact on satisfaction with the neighborhood. Negative health effects are observed in a number of studies and these stimulate the negative feelings in the exposed population. The noise produced by traffic is one of the most important contributors to the appreciation of the quality of life. Thus, it is useful to define a number of indicators that allow monitoring the current impact of noise on the quality of life and predicting the effect of future developments. This work investigates and compares a set of indicators related to exposure at home and exposure during trips around the house. The latter require detailed modeling of the population's trip behavior. The validity of the indicators is checked by their ability to predict the outcome of a social survey and by outlining potential causal paths between them and the outcome variables considered: general satisfaction with the quality of life in the neighborhood, noise annoyance at home, and reported traffic density in the area.},

abstract = {This paper offers a new approach to understanding, improving and designing soundscapes. “Soundscape” means all the sounds that can be heard in a specific location. Soundscapes can be understood only through peoples' perceptions, and this paper proposes using those perceptions to link soundscape improvement and design with traditional noise control methods. Decades of experience have yielded in-depth understanding of how undesirable sounds may be controlled or reduced. The control methods, however, are generally applicable to single sources of sound while soundscapes are composed of multiple sounds. Using human judgments, first in the laboratory and later in the field, it will be possible to deconstruct any soundscape into its desirable and undesirable sounds, which may then, one-by-one, be subjected to proven methods of noise control. This approach includes complications, not the least of which is deciding how much the undesirable sounds should be reduced to perceptually improve the soundscape. Previous published studies, primarily laboratory, but also field studies, suggest that initial laboratory work followed by increasingly complex field applications, should result in an understanding of how soundscapes can be improved and desirable ones designed.},

Nonetheless, acousticians are usually involved too late in the urban planning process, when there is already a severe noise problem. A holistic strategy for urban sound planning, that could improve the planning process preventing such problems to become a reality, is being developed within SONORUS.
SONORUS is a research and training programme (under the FP7 People Programme of the EU) in urban sound planning. The training will include technical knowledge in specific fields (prediction methods, soundscaping and noise control engineering), planning skills (urban planning, spatial planning, traffic planning and cost-benefit-analysis) and public outreach skills (communication, leadership, auralization and visualisation tools). The researchers trained within this programme will have a complete profile on urban planning and should be able to understand the acoustic concerns in context with the complexity that such problems usually present and that require a concept going beyond pure noise abatement.
The holistic strategy binds together the knowledge acquired in the different themes and establishes
a communication bridge with all the stakeholders of the planning process in order to obtain healthier urban environments. This paper will focus on the holistic strategy and the steps that led to its development so far. A description of selected test sites and challenges presented by each of SONORUS city partners: Antwerp, Brighton, Gothenburg, Rome and Rotterdam, will complete

A case study was performed in urban spaces and the results were compared with those of the group soundwalk to validate the individual soundwalk procedure. Thirty subjects (15 architects and 15 acousticians) participated in the soundwalk. During the soundwalk, the subjects selected a total of 196 positions, and those were classified into 4 groups. It was found that soundscape perceptions were dominated by acoustic comfort, visual images, and openness. It was also revealed that perceived elements of the acoustic environment and visual image differed across classified soundscape groups, and there was a difference between architects and acousticians in terms of how they described their impressions of the soundscape elements. The results show that the individual soundwalk procedure has advantages for measuring diverse subjective responses and for obtaining the perceived elements of the urban soundscape.},

direction, where important recovery of the shielding lost by screen-induced wind refraction was observed. However, opposite effects are possible at longer distance. This can be explained by shifts in the zones with strong (positive) gradients in the horizontal component of the wind
speed. Leaving a gap between the barrier top and canopy bottom helps reducing these negative effects at longer distance, and results in a
generally optimized performance downwind. Trees behind noise walls at either side of the source lead to a full cancelling of wind effects at
short distance, but to strong negative effects at longer distances downwind. Trees as windbreaks seem to be especially useful near single,
vertically erected noise walls. Near steep berms, no net effect of trees is predicted. The design rules presented in this paper are derived based on numerical calculations with a previously validated CFD-FDTD-PE model.},

In this study, the acoustic comfort influenced by three visual landscape factors was examined based on audiovisual experiments. The results indicate that although landscape factors can influence the acoustic comforts of 11 types of sounds in different ways, the audiovisual matching contexts resulting in higher acoustic comforts are presented regularly. The analysis of the effect of landscape objects suggests that the acoustic comforts of the sounds relating to people's participation are increased by artificial landscape objects compared with those under the effect of natural landscape objects, whereas natural landscape objects closely match natural sounds, as well as the sounds with music-related and melodic characteristics. In terms of the effect of the distance to water edge, the acoustic comfort score (based on a five-point scale) of children frolic is higher with a closer view of a waterscape, by 1.06, compared to that with a distant view, whereas the distant view continuously increases the evaluation scores of road traffic sound by 0.50 per 10dBA at 30–50dBA compared to those with the closer view. In terms of the effect of the appearance of animals and humans, the coherence between audio and visual environment is: with the appearance of animals, the evaluations of natural sounds are higher compared to those without, whereas with the appearance of humans, the evaluations of the sounds relating to people's participation are higher compared to those without.},

Beyond the assumption that a correct implementation of the NIP will significantly reduce sound exposure, this research aims to determine the efficacy of the NIP as a result of the beneficiaries' subjective perception in terms of satisfaction, and the reduction of the reported annoyance. A telephone survey was carried out in more than 650 dwellings in the surroundings of several Spanish Airports (Alicante, Bilbao, Grand Canary, Malaga, Palma de Mallorca). The results have shown that: (a) the beneficiaries have a generally positive perception regarding the actions implemented, (b) they are quite satisfied regarding the insulation of the fa{\c{c}}ades after NIP implementation, (c) they report a reduction of the annoyance, but (d) they still perceive aircraft noise as a source of disturbance. The statistical analysis of the results has also shown that there are some non-acoustic factors influencing citizens' perception of NIPs. Factors such as the aesthetic of windows, or the reliability and professionalism of the workers and technicians involved in the NIP, have been shown to modify people's reaction. But, the dissatisfaction with legal aspects of Spanish regulations concerning a lower protection of some practical spaces (like, bathrooms and kitchens that have been left out in many cases) has been found to be the factor most affecting people's response.},

abstract = {Much of the research evidence relating to the physical learning environment of schools is inconclusive, contradictory or incomplete. Nevertheless, within this confusing area, research from a number of disciplines, using a range of methodologies, points to the negative impact of noise on students' learning. In this paper, drawing on our systematic review of learning environments we review the weight of evidence in relation to noise, considering what implications the results of these studies have for the design and use of learning spaces in schools. We make four key points. Firstly that noise over a given level does appear to have a negative impact on learning. Secondly that beneath these levels noise may or may not be problematic, depending on the social, cultural and pedagogical expectations of the students and teachers. Thirdly we argue that when noise is deemed to be a difficulty, this finding cannot simply be translated into design prescriptions. The reasons for this indeterminacy include differing understandings of the routes through which noise produces learning deficits, as well as relationships between noise and other elements of the environment, particularly the impacts of physical solutions to noise problems. Finally, we suggest that solutions to noise problems will not be produced by viewing noise in isolation, or even as part of the physical environment, but through participatory approaches to understanding and adapting the structure, organisation and use of learning spaces in schools.},

Noise maps are constructed for the day–evening–night-time and night-time periods and levels of population exposure are estimated for the same periods. In methodological terms, the research uses the UK's calculation of road traffic noise (CRTN) method for calculating noise levels in the study area. This method has been adopted as the interim calculation method by the Irish authorities responsible for meeting the obligations set out in the EU Environmental Noise Directive (END). The research also investigates the usefulness of three noise mitigation measures for ‘acoustical planning' purposes: traffic reductions, speed reductions and erection of acoustical barriers. The results indicate that levels of population exposure during night-time are extremely high relative to guideline limits set down by the World Health Organisation. In addition, the results highlight the significant role that certain noise mitigation measures can play in good ‘acoustical planning'.},

Therefore, roof shape can be considered as an important means to limit sound pressure levels at a quiet side; various researchers indicated that the presence of silent zones and fa{\c{c}}ades may limit city noise annoyance.

Several personal and environmental factors known to affect resting cardiovascular parameters measured under well-controlled, clinical conditions were incorporated into the analyses. Children with premature births and elevated chronic stress (i.e., overnight cortisol) were more susceptible to adverse blood pressure responses to road traffic noise. Residence in a multi-dwelling unit as well as standardized assessments of perceived quietness of the area did not modify the traffic noise impacts but each had its own, independent effect on resting blood pressure. A primary air pollutant associated with traffic volume (NO2) had no influence on any of these results. The scope of environmental noise assessment and management would benefit from incorporation of a more contextualized approach as suggested by the soundscape perspective.},

The potential of wall vegetation systems, green roofs, vegetated low screens at roof edges, and also combinations of such treatments, have been studied by means of combining 2D and 3D full-wave numerical methodologies. This study is concerned with road traffic noise propagation towards the traffic-free sides of inner-city buildings (courtyards). Preserving quietness at such locations has been shown before to be beneficial for the health and well-being of citizens. The results in this study show that green roofs have the highest potential to enhance quietness in courtyards. Favourable combinations of roof shape and green roofs have been identified. Vegetated fa{\c{c}}ades are most efficient when applied to narrow city canyons with otherwise acoustically hard fa{\c{c}}ade materials. Greening of the upper storey's in the street and (full) fa{\c{c}}ades in the courtyard itself is most efficient to achieve noise reduction. Low-height roof screens were shown to be effective when multiple screens are placed, but only on conditions that their faces are absorbing. The combination of different greening measures results in a lower combined effect than when the separate effects would have been linearly added. The combination of green roofs or wall vegetation with roof screens seems most interesting.},

The goal of SiRENE is to investigate acute, short- and long-term e{\_}ects of road, railway and aircraft noise exposure on annoyance, sleep disturbances and cardio-metabolic risk.

The study is based on a detailed Swiss-wide assessment of transportation noise exposure, including diurnal distributions. The exposure analysis comprises current as well as historical exposure calculations for up to 20 years in the past.

We present the major challenges of compiling sufficient data to support a Swiss-wide model for all buildings and including all transport infrastructure as a basis for the subsequent SiRENE sound exposure analysis for the years 2011, 2001 and 1991. The task is particularly challenging for the early years due to poor data quality and/or lack of availability. We address the integration of geo-referenced input datasets from various sources and time periods, the assignment of tra{\_}c noise exposure from fa{\c{c}}ade points to dwelling units, as well as the processing of traffic information and statistics. Preliminary results of the noise exposure calculations are presented.

A questionnaire study was conducted in urban residential areas with road-traffic noise exposure between L(Aeq,24h) 58 to 68 dB at the most exposed fa{\c{c}}ade. The dwellings had "quiet" indoor section/s and faced a "quiet" outdoor courtyard (L(Aeq,24h) {\textless} 48 dB fa{\c{c}}ade reflex included). Data were collected from 385 residents and four groups were formed based on sound-level categories (58-62 and 63-68 dB) and classification of the "quiet" courtyards into groups with low and high physical environmental quality. At both sound-level categories, the results indicate that access to high-quality "quiet" courtyards is associated with less noise annoyance and noise-disturbed outdoor activities among the residents. Compared to low-quality "quiet" courtyards, high-quality courtyards can function as an attractive restorative environment providing residents with a positive soundscape, opportunities for rest, relaxation and play as well as social relations that potentially reduce the adverse effects of noise. However, access to quietness and a high-quality courtyard can only compensate partly for high sound levels at fa{\c{c}}ades facing the streets, thus, 16{\%} and 29{\%} were still noise annoyed at 58-62 and 63-68 dB, respectively.

abstract = {Road traffic noise propagation through a vegetation belt of limited depth (15m) containing periodically arranged trees along a road is numerically assessed by means of 3D finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) calculations. The computational cost is reduced by only modeling a representative strip of the planting scheme and assuming periodic extension by applying mirror planes. With increasing tree stem diameter and decreasing spacing, traffic noise insertion loss is predicted to be more pronounced for each planting scheme considered (simple cubic, rectangular, triangular and face-centered cubic). For rectangular schemes, the spacing parallel to the road axis is predicted to be the determining parameter for the acoustic performance. Significant noise reduction is predicted to occur for a tree spacing of less than 3m and a tree stem diameter of more than 0.11m. This positive effect comes on top of the increase in ground effect (near 3dBA for a light vehicle at 70km/h) when compared to sound propagation over grassland. The noise reducing effect of the forest floor and the optimized tree belt arrangement are found to be of similar importance in the calculations performed. The effect of shrubs with typical above-ground biomass is estimated to be at maximum 2dBA in the uniform scattering approach applied for a light vehicle at 70km/h. Downward scattering from tree crowns is predicted to be smaller than 1dBA for a light vehicle at 70km/h, for various distributions of scattering elements representing the tree crown. The effect of the presence of tree stems, shrubs and tree crowns is predicted to be approximately additive. Inducing some (pseudo)randomness in stem center location, tree diameter, and omitting a limited number of rows with trees seem to hardly affect the insertion loss. These predictions suggest that practically achievable vegetation belts can compete to the noise reducing performance of a classical thin noise barrier (on grassland) with a height of 1–1.5m (in a non-refracting atmosphere).},

Although experimental studies are common to quantify the effects of noise and vibration on buildings and on people, their reach is limited since the causes of vibrations can rarely be deduced from data records. This paper presents the numerical calculations that allow evaluating the main contributions of railway-induced ground vibrations in the vicinity of buildings. The reference case is the Brussels Region and, more particularly, the T2000 tram circulating in Brussels city. Based on a pertinent selection of the vibration assessment indicators and a numerical prediction approach, various results are presented and show that the free-field analysis is often improperly used in this kind of analysis as the interaction of soil and structure is required. Calculated high ground vibrations stem from singular rail surface defects. The use of resilient wheels is recommended in order to reduce the ground-borne noise and vibration to permissible values.},

The ultimate goal is to objectively and comparably manage the impact and evolution of environmental noise caused both by urban agglomerations and by traffic infrastructures (roads, rails and airports). The use of common indices and methodologies (together with five-year plan assessment required by the authorities in charge) should show how noise pollution levels are evolving plus the effectiveness of corrective measures implemented in the action plans. In this paper, available results fromnumerous European agglomerations (with particular emphasis on Spanish agglomerations) are compared and analysed. The impact and its evolution are based on the percentage of people exposed to noise. More specifically, it demonstrates the impact caused by road traffic, which proves to be the main noise source in all agglomerations. In many cases, the results are extremely remarkable. In some case, the results are illogical. For such cases, it can be concluded that either assessment methodologies have been signifi- cantly amended or the input variables to the calculation programs have been remarkably changed. The uncertainty associated with the results is such that, in our opinion, no conclusions can be drawn concerning the effectiveness of remedial measures designed within the action plans after the Directive's first implementation Phase.},

abstract = {An open source implementation of the pseudospectral time-domain method for the propagation of sound is presented, which is geared towards applications in the built environment. Being a wavebased method, PSTD captures phenomena like diffraction, but maintains efficiency in processing time and memory usage as it allows to spatially sample close to the Nyquist criterion, thus keeping both the required spatial and temporal resolution coarse. As a first step, in this implementation it
has been opted to model the boundary geometry as a composition of rectangular two-dimensional subdomains, hence initially restricting the implementation to orthogonal and two-dimensional situations. The strategy of using subdomains divides the problem domain into local subsets, which enables the simulation software to be built according to Object-Oriented Programming best practices and allows room for further computational parallelization. The software is built using the open source components, Blender, Numpy and Python, and has been published under an open ource license itself as well. Research is still being done on strategies to model non-orthogonal
geometries and curvilinear grid generation to allow arbitrary geometries as input. Furthermore,
impedance boundary conditions and source directivity will be added in subsequent installments, based oncurrent ongoing research, as well as local grid refinement, a moving medium and further peformance improvements by implementing GPU computing. Especially when the
implementation is extended into a three-dimensional solution, these performance improvements are expected to be essential in order to be fast enough to ensure usability in practice.},

Noise shielding is mainly obtained as a combination of multiple scattering in the tree trunk layer and due to the presence of an acoustically soft soil. A large dataset of full-wave and highly detailed numerical simulations, based as much as possible on measured input data, shows that high biomass density should be strived for as a general rule. This conflicts, however, with practical limitations regarding access to light, nutrients and water for the trees. Some interesting approaches have been identified to relax the need for high biomass density, without affecting noise shielding to an important extent. Rectangular planting schemes, where the spacing orthogonal to the road can be increased, omitting full rows parallel to the road length axis, and thinning inside the belt are examples of such measures. It is discussed that the specific choice of a planting scheme could make a tree belt along a road an efficient noise reducing measure or not.},

There was a significant correlation between the mean hearing loss and the tinnitus loudness (p {\textless} 0.0001). Interestingly, patients suffering from decompensated chronic tinnitus had a greater degree of hearing loss than the patients with compensated form of tinnitus. In addition, we demonstrate that the degree of hearing loss positively correlates with the two subscales ("intrusiveness" and "auditory perceptional difficulties") of the Tinnitus Questionnaire.

abstract = {Noise maps are usually represented as contour or isolines maps describing the sound levels in a region. Using this kind of representation the user can easily find the noise level assigned to every location in the map. But the acoustic calculations behind the map are not performed for every single location on it; they are only performed in a grid of receivers. The results in this calculation grid are interpolated to draw the isolines or contours. Therefore, the resolution of the calculation grid and the way it was created (rectangular, triangulated, random{\ldots}) have an effect on the resulting map. In this paper we describe a smart iterative procedure to optimize the quality of the map at a really low additional computational cost, using self-adaptive grids for the acoustic calculations. These self-adaptive grids add new receivers to the sampling grid in those locations where they are expected to be more useful, so that the performance at the output of the interpolator is enhanced. Self-adaptive sampling grids can be used for minimizing the overall error of the map (improving its quality), or for reducing calculation times, and can be also applied selectively to target areas or contour lines. This can be done by the user customizing the maximum number of iterations, the number of new receivers for each iteration, the target isolines, the target quality{\ldots}},

The noise levels at 25 locations close to roads were measured and compared with the expected noise levels to verify the developed noise map. An excess noise map was generated by comparing the road-traffic noise map with a noise-standard map. Using the excess noise map, the areas exceeding environmental noise standards were effectively evaluated through a GIS space analysis.

abstract = {Shielded urban areas are of importance regarding urban citizens' annoyance and adverse health effects related to road traffic noise. This work extends the existing knowledge of sound propagation to such areas by a scale model study, rather than by model calculations. The scale model study was executed for two parallel urban canyons at a 1 to 40 scale, with a point source located in one canyon. Cases with acoustically hard fa{\c{c}}ades and absorption and diffusion fa{\c{c}}ade treatments were in vestigated. To correct for excess air attenuation of the measurements, a wavelet-based method has been applied. The measurement results in the shielded canyon show that, in contrast
to the directly exposed street canyon, the levels and the decay times are quite constant over the length of the canyon. The energy-time curve in the shielded canyon is characterized by a rise time, which can be related to the sound pressure level. The rise times and decays can be explained by separate reflection, diffraction and diffusion processes. A closed courtyard situation enlarges the level difference between acoustically hard fa{\c{c}}ades and applied fa{\c{c}}ade absorption or diffusion treatments at both the directly exposed and shielded side. A  comparison between measurements with two different diffusion mechanisms, horizontal and vertical diffusion, reveals that vertical diffusion yields lower levels at the shielded side compared to horizontal diffusion for the investigated situations.},

Drawing on the development of international good practice guidelines and research into noise and vibration annoyance, a number of challenges that arise in developing such a survey are addressed. The issues include the development of rating scales for annoyance and social factors, decisions regarding the terminology used in the survey to define annoyance, different sources of vibration, and how respondents' consider the residential area of investigation when completing the survey. The process highlights the need to combine disciplines, in this case applying knowledge from social sciences and acoustics in order to ensure the collection of robust and reliable data. The final survey developed from this process was used in a national survey in the United Kingdom which aimed to produce exposure–response relationships for vibration and annoyance in relation to railway activity, construction activity, and internal vibration sources.},

But what happens in protected and quiet areas, like courtyards or parks? They are partly shielded from the previously mentioned sources, but many others might be relevant: maintenance and repair work, glass recycling, loud music, car parking, ventilation and cooling systems, etc. The Sonorus project considers every aspect of the urban sound environment in its holistic approach to the matter. Hence, if non-traffic sources play an important role in quiet areas, they should be analyzed and characterized, in order to evaluate how such sources will affect the environment. This paper presents the outcome of the first stage of one of the research projects within Sonorus, the characterization and synthesis of a fan sound for auralization purposes. The technique used is based on spectral modelling synthesis. The input parameters to the model can be varied in order to simulate various running conditions, such as variable fan speed. The source synthesis is combined with a propagation model in order to complete the auralization process.},

Several personal and environmental factors known to affect resting cardiovascular parameters measured under well-controlled, clinical conditions were incorporated into the analyses. Children with premature births and elevated chronic stress (i.e., overnight cortisol) were more susceptible to adverse blood pressure responses to road traffic noise. Residence in a multi-dwelling unit as well as standardized assessments of perceived quietness of the area did not modify the traffic noise impacts but each had its own, independent effect on resting blood pressure. A primary air pollutant associated with traffic volume (NO2) had no influence on any of these results. The scope of environmental noise assessment and management would benefit from incorporation of a more contextualized approach as suggested by the soundscape perspective.},

In order to predict how people would perceive an acoustic environment, it is central to identify the underlying acoustic properties of soundscapes. In this study these properties were approached by investigating the visual similarity of colour prints
of 50 audio spectrograms (time vs. frequency), representing audio recordings of a variety of acoustic environments. In total, 15 female and 15 male students from the University of Sheffield were recruited to assess the 50 spectrograms by sorting them into groups based on how similar
they were perceived to be. A distance matrix, derived from the sorting data, was subjected to a Multidimensional Scaling analysis to map the underlying dimensions of similarity among the spectrograms, which are proposed to represent the underlying acoustic properties of the
corresponding acoustic environments. Three dimensions were identified. The first dimension relates to Distinguishable–Indistinguishable sound sources, the second dimension to Background–Foreground sounds, and the third dimension to Intrusive–Smooth sound sources. The results also
show that established acoustic parameters are inappropriate as indicators of acoustic environments

Soundwalks along the perimeter of each square were performed during daylight and weekdays taking binaural and video recordings, as well as spot measurements of illuminance. The cluster analysis performed on the physical parameters, not only acoustic, provided two clusters that are in satisfactory agreement with the "a priori" classification. Applying the principal component analysis (PCA) to five physical parameters, two main components were obtained which might be associated to two environmental features, namely, "chaotic/calm" and "open/enclosed." On the basis of these two features, six squares were selected for the laboratory audio-video tests where 32 subjects took part filling in a questionnaire. The PCA performed on the subjective ratings on the sonic environment showed two main components which might be associated to two emotional meanings, namely, "calmness" and "vibrancy." The linear regression modeling between five objective parameters and the mean value of subjective ratings on chaotic/calm and enclosed/open attributes showed a good correlation. Notwithstanding these interesting results being limited to the specific data set, it is worth pointing out that the complexity of the soundscape quality assessment can be more comprehensively examined merging the field measurements of physical parameters with the subjective ratings provided by field and/or laboratory tests.},

abstract = {Due to the rapid urban development and massive population increase in many eastern cities, the difference in urban density and morphology between typical western and eastern cities is becoming significant. This consequently makes the noise distribution in the eastern cities rather different from typical low density European cities. In this research, two representative cities with different urban densities, Greater Manchester in the UK and Wuhan in China, were selected, which have low and high average urban density respectively, and also have considerable differences in building form and traffic pattern. In the mean time, these two cities have similar urban scale and traffic amount. In each city, based on the urban morphological analyses considering urban land-use, building and road density, and noise source distribution, a number of typical urban areas, 500*500m2 each, were sampled. A noise-mapping software package was then used to generate generic noise maps, based on existing digital vector maps for terrain and building, and traffic data obtained by on-site measurements. The comparison results show that the average and minimum noise level in Greater Manchester samples is generally higher than that in Wuhan samples, while the maximum noise level in Wuhan samples is mostly higher. By developing a Matlab program, correlations have been analysed between noise distributions and the urban characteristics relating to urban density, such as the road and building coverage ratio. Overall, comparisons between these two typical cities have shown significant effects of urban morphology on the traffic noise distribution.},

A novel contribution of the study is that it examines how chronic noise exposure relates to blood pressure responses during exposure to both noise and non-noise acute stressors. The acute noise stressor was recorded street noise and the non-noise stressor was mental arithmetic. The sample consisted of 189 3rd and 6th grade children (51.9{\%} percent boys; 52.9{\%} 3rd graders) from a noisy (n = 95) or relatively quiet (n = 94) public school in the city of Pune, India. There were no statistically significant differences between chronic noise levels and resting blood pressure levels. However, relative to quiet-school children, noisy-school children had significantly lower increases in blood pressure when exposed to either an acute noise or non-noise stressor. This finding suggests that chronic noise exposure may result in hypo-reactivity to a variety of stressors and not just habituation to noise stressors.},

To quantify this effect of trees with a view to including it in numerical predictions, this paper examines sound scattering from a single tree in open field by means of reverberation time (RT). Five trees of different species and crown sizes were considered. The influence of ground condition, receiver height, crown size and shape, foliage condition, and source-receiver angle and distance has been assessed. The results show that RT20 is proportional to the tree crown size, which is the most important factor. The maximum RT20 measured was 0.28 s at 4000 Hz for the studied trees when in leaf (with foliage). The presence of leaves increased RT20 at high frequencies, typically by 0.08 s at 4000 Hz. It was also demonstrated that the source-receiver angle can affect the characteristics of decay curves significantly. With increasing source-receiver distance within 40 m, RT20 was slightly changed. It was shown that ground condition and receiver height affect the decay curves, especially at low and mid frequencies, where sound scattering is of relatively limited importance.},

abstract = {The European Union has provided in recent years (and is going to update) several tools to harmonise noise mapping methodologies through directives and guidelines. Unfortunately the same efforts have not been put in the harmonisation of approaches for Noise Action Plans, the effective instruments to manage noise impacts. As a consequence, each European Member State at national or even at local level defined its own methodology, usually considerably different one from the others. Nevertheless, the most common approach to deal with noise impact at a policy, economic and strategy level is the use of priority indices focused to highlight areas or buildings where mitigation actions are more advisable or urgent. The aim of the present research is to provide a review of the most used European priority indices and also to test some of them in a study area. The comparative analysis demonstrates that the method chosen for the prioritisation deeply affects the ranking of the areas where noise measures need to be realized. Some methods tend to give high priority to noise sensitive locations, others to high populated buildings, and others to the areas where noise levels are high. The study proves how much common approaches are needed also for Noise Action Plans to reach a coherent noise policy within European boundaries.},

The method uses the results of a training phase for the observation of statistical distributions of sound pressure and sound intensity related parameters. The different parameters' weights are computed analyzing the overlap of probability distributions of takeoffs and landings, so that more relevance is given to the quantities presenting a low risk of misclassification. The proposed method does not require any arbitrary assumption about the parameter effectiveness, given that the indications of multiple (potentially infinite) classifiers can be merged together with weights that minimize the chance of misclassification. The method has been validated with measurements performed at the Milan Malpensa airport (Italy). Results outlined that the proposed classification criterion correctly identifies approximately 99{\%} of events.},

Skin conductance level (SCL) was used to index sympathetic activation, and high frequency heart rate variability (HF HRV) was used to index parasympathetic activation. Although HF HRV showed no effects, SCL recovery tended to be faster during natural sound than noisy environments. These results suggest that nature sounds facilitate recovery from sympathetic activation after a psychological stressor.},

abstract = {The finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method to solve the linearised equations of fluid dynamics has shown to be very powerful and useful in outdoor sound propagation. Practical applications are however limited due to the large need for computational resources. The numerical discretisation influences computational efficiency to an important degree. In this paper, some possible ways to discretise temporal derivatives are studied. Two obvious ways of time-discretisation namely staggered-in-time (SIT) and a simple collocated-in-time (CIT) scheme are compared to the prediction-step staggered-in-time (PSIT) scheme. The latter is intended to be used for the calculation of sound propagation in the typical low wind speeds encountered in the outdoor environment at low heights above the earth's surface. It was shown that the PSIT scheme is more stable than the SIT scheme, so practical calculations are possible. Computational efficiency is increased to an important degree compared to the CIT scheme. The numerical accuracy (more precisely the amplitude error) of the PSIT scheme is an important improvement upon SIT. The CIT scheme on the other hand conserves amplitude better. The amplitude error becomes larger with increasing wind speed because of some simplifications during the numerical discretisation. In low wind speeds, the PSIT algorithm can serve as an interesting compromise between numerical accuracy and the required amount of computing power.},

abstract = {Sound scattering due to atmospheric turbulence limits the noise reduction in shielded areas. An engineering model is presented, aimed to predict the scattered level for general noise mapping purposes including sound propagation between urban canyons. Energy based single scattering for homogeneous and isotropic turbulence following the Kolmogorov model is assumed as a starting point and a saturation based on the von K{\'{a}}rm{\'{a}}n model is used as a first-order multiple scattering approximation. For a single shielding obstacle the scattering model is used to calculate a large dataset as function of the effective height of the shielding obstacle and its distances to source and receiver. A parameterisation of the dataset is used when calculating the influence of single or double canyons, including standardised air attenuation rates as well as fa{\c{c}}ade absorption and Fresnel weighting of the multiple fa{\c{c}}ade reflections. Assuming a single point source, an aver aging over three receiver positions and that each ground reflection causes energy doubling, the final engineering model is formulated as a scattered level for a shielding building without canyon plus a correction term for the effect of a single or a double canyon, assuming a flat rooftop of the shielding building. Input parameters are, in addition to geometry and sound frequency, the strengths of velocity and temperature turbulence. },

abstract = {An altered acoustic environment can have severe consequences for natural communities, especially for species that use acoustic signals to communicate and achieve breeding success. Numerous studies have focused on traffic noise disturbance, but the possible causes of road effects are inter-correlated and the literature on noise qua noise is sometimes contradictory. To provide further empirical data in this regard, the authors investigated the spatio-temporal variability of the singing dynamics of an avian community living in an acoustic context altered by traffic noise. Fieldwork was carried out in a wood of Turkey oaks (central Italy) bordered on one side by a main road. The soundscape was examined by positioning eight digital recorders, distributed in two transects perpendicular to the road, and recording between 6:30 and 8.30 a.m. for 12 continuous sessions. The acoustic complexity index was used to obtain a quantification of singing dynamics, which were positively correlated with traffic noise. This may indicate that birds try to propagate their signals with greater emphasis (e.g., amplified redundancy or loudness of the songs) to override the masking effect of noise. Nevertheless, an ecotonal effect could have influenced the correlation results, with this enhanced dynamic possibly being due to a more densely populated environment.},

On the basis of selected acoustical descriptors, the sonic environment of the three parks was categorized and, thanks to statistical analysis, three clusters were identified. The results confirm that the sound environment in urban parks is often considered as "good" or "excellent" even if the sound pressure level is nearly always higher than the limits commonly used to define quiet areas. This is due to the influence of other factors, such as the presence of trees, natural features, and the tranquility; all of these components cannot be neglected in the assessment of the soundscape because they directly affect the psychological state of the person.},

This paper presents the results of an acoustic evaluation conducted in areas adjacent to federal highway BR-116, part of which lies within the urban limits of the city of Curitiba in southern Brazil. In situ measurements were taken of the noise levels, from which noise maps were drawn in different stages of the implementation of the road restructuring project called the Green Line. After calibration, a computational model was used to evaluate an operational scenario of the highway in the future. The results of the mappings were compared with reference noise emission values established by municipal legislation. The maps revealed the existence of noise pollution in the urban stretch of the federal highway in all the scenarios [LAeq{\textgreater}65dB(A)]. Efforts to control environmental noise in cities are aided by computational models for urban planning. These models are extremely helpful for environmental management and decision-making by public authorities for solutions to potential environmental risks, as is the case of urban noise.},

The main goal of the work is to demonstrate the feasibility of the active technique to limit the loss of attenuation due to the aperture of windows, and its application to aircraft fly-over incident noise. The experimental window is placed in an exposed fa{\c{c}}ade of a dwelling close to an airport and subject to fly-by aircraft noise. The active control is configured to cancel the pressure at the aperture using a single-input single-output feedforward adaptive system. As a result, a reduction of sound transmission is achieved with low power consumption. In global terms, an increase of almost 3dB of transmission loss (with respect to the partially opened window insulation values) in the low frequency range (below 160Hz and according to the National Danish Method for evaluating low frequency noise) is demonstrated, which is equivalent to a reduction of 50{\%} in the loss of insulation caused by opening the window.},

abstract = {In contrast to traditional noise maps like those produced in the framework of the European Commission's Environmental Noise Directive, dynamic noise maps are introduced in this work. Dynamic noise maps are based on a combination of noise monitoring networks and a long-term averaged noise map.
The proposed interpolating model is inspired by land-use regression models, which are commonly used in air pollution monitoring. Obvious noise indicators like equivalent sound pressure levels can be mapped with a time resolution down to 15 minutes. Dynamic noise maps could therefore provide a more complete picture of the city noise climate and lie closer to human observations. An important prerequisite is that a reasonably good long-term averaged model for the sound indicators in the area under study is available. Temporal variations arise from changes in the noise source and variations in the propagation of sound. In addition, the presence of sources that are generally not considered in noise maps often add to the dynamic character. The interpolation model tunes the source characteristics and propagation aspects on the basis of measurements providing a prediction of the momentary sound pressure levels at locations where no measurements are available. The proposed dynamic maps could be well suited to predict noise-related effects where the temporal aspect is important like annoyance and sleep disturbance.},

A total of ten sites with varying landscape metrics were chosen for audio-visual recording. The acoustical characteristics of the high-speed train noise were analyzed using various noise level indices. Landscape metrics such as the percentage of natural features (NF) and Shannon's diversity index (SHDI) were adopted to evaluate the landscape features of the ten sites. Laboratory experiments were then performed with 20 well-trained listeners to investigate the perception of high-speed train noise in rural areas. The experiments consisted of three parts: 1) visual-only condition, 2) audio-only condition, and 3) combined audio-visual condition. The results showed that subjects' preference for visual images was significantly related to NF, the number of land types, and the A-weighted equivalent sound pressure level (LAeq). In addition, the visual images significantly influenced the noise annoyance, and LAeq and NF were the dominant factors affecting the annoyance from high-speed train noise in the combined audio-visual condition. In addition, Zwicker's loudness (N) was highly correlated with the annoyance from high-speed train noise in both the audio-only and audio-visual conditions.},

Subjective appraisals of the soundscapes were also considered when examining the relationship between soundscape and physiological response. Following a stress task, larger decreases in heart rate were associated with the least eventful, soundscapes. When at rest, sounds perceived as pleasant produced lower skin conductance levels compared to sounds perceived as unpleasant. Together these findings suggest that autonomic function during stress recovery and at rest can be influenced by subjective response to the acoustic environment. Further, the co-variance between subjective estimates of, and physiological response to, soundscapes suggests there is some worth in developing self-report soundscape surveys as a tool to use when considering soundscapes accessible to the public.},

To evaluate their usability practically, the Soundscape of recreational areas has to be examined. This paper focuses on finding the relationship between the physical acoustical parameters and human perceptions in landscape which is exposed to traffic noise. Several acoustical parameters such as the L A10 and L eq are highly correlated with the subjective perception of users such as the pleasantness, loudness, interference with verbal communication, preference to stay and acceptance of an environment. The acoustical criterion of L eq or L A10 for users to perceive a park as being pleasant and wishing to stay willingly at the park has been found from statistical analysis. It is found that respondents perceive parks as pleasant environments when L Aeq or L A10 is below 60 dB or 63 dB respectively; and they are willing to stay in parks when L Aeq or L A10 is less than 61 dB and 64 dB respectively. The majority of people expect to hear the sound of birdcalls, water flow, music, and talking in recreational areas, but they dislike hearing the sound of heavy and light vehicles, screaming, horns, aeroplanes, and sirens.

Situations involving a single and double diffraction over the green roof were considered, for substrate thicknesses ranging from 20–30mm to 180mm, and for vegetation cover ranging from absence to 100{\%}. The green roof acoustic effect was analyzed for propagation path lengths interacting with the roofs ranging from 2.5m to 25m. Measurements show that green roofs might lead to consistent and significant sound reduction at locations where only diffracted sound waves arrive relative to common, non-vegetated roofs. A single diffraction case with an acoustic green roof improvement exceeding10 dB was found for sound frequencies between 400Hz and 1250Hz, although the green roof interaction path length was only 4.5m. For less shielded receivers, a change in interference pattern might be observed, leading to positive or negative effects, relative to a non-vegetated roof top. For the double diffraction cases the green roof improvement is less frequency-dependent and a case with positive effects up to 10dB was found.},

abstract = {Day time noise level computation by traffic noise model requires realistic traffic data that is hardly ever available for every single street, therefore direct noise levels measurements may be the alternative. However, direct, continuous measurement of the day time noise level (equivalent level from 7am to 7pm) is an expensive strategy if a whole city must be assessed. To overcome this situation, short-term measurements of variable duration are often taken in order to estimate the day time noise level (Ld) because they are less expensive and resource demanding than continuous measurements over a whole day or more. From a set of continuous measurements over more than 48h in 137 streets of nine different cities, the present work quantifies the error committed when using short-term noise measurements as a function of interval length measurement. To enhance estimation accuracy, both a street categorization and a temporal categorization have been attempted: in first place, it is found that the difference between the short-term noise level and Ld follows a different distribution for main roads than for ordinary streets, therefore the error committed depends on the street category. To be specific, when estimating Ld from a 15min short time measurement the error committed would be ±2dB with a percent population coverage of 90{\%}, in the case of main streets and in the case of ordinary streets the same error range covers 72.5{\%} of the population. In second place, if the measurement range time is restricted (temporal categorization) from 9am to 1pm and from 2pm to 5pm in the case of ordinary streets, the percent population coverage increases to 90{\%} when the error range is ±3dB. When referring to main streets, the measurement range of time is limited from 10am to 5pm to obtain an increase of 2{\%} of the percent population coverage when the error is ±1 and ±2dB.},

abstract = {The DUET (Degenerative Unmixing and Estimation Technique) algorithm has been shown to be an effective method for the separation of multiple sources from a stereo mixture. We present a time–frequency masking technique based on DUET for the blind separation of N sources from a four channel B format audio mixture. This method is applicable where sources that are both radially sparse in three dimensions, and exhibit approximate W-disjoint orthogonality, i.e. where the signals are approximately sparse in the time–frequency domain. Using the B-format mixture, we generate a three dimensional power-weighted geodesic histogram and show the peak locations correspond to the direction of arrival of the sources. These peaks are then used to generate a time–frequency mask to separate the sources from the w-channel of the B-format mixture. Experimental separation results using speech signals are presented.},

@article{Can2014,
abstract = {This paper investigates the relevance of different interpolation techniques to improve the spatial resolution of urban noise maps, in complement to measurements achieved at fixed stations. Interpolation techniques based on mobile measurements are compared to usual spatial interpolations techniques, namely Inverse Distance Weighting and Kriging. The analyses rely on a measurement campaign, which consisted of nearly 8 h of geo-referenced mobile noise measurements performed at random moments of the day, conducted simultaneously with continuous measurements collected at five fixed stations located on the inner city of Gent, Belgium.

Firstly, a procedure is proposed to build a noise map with a high spatial resolution (one point every 5 m). The procedure relies on both mobile and fixed measurements: the mobile measurements are used to capture spatial variations on the network, and the measurements at fixed stations are used to capture the temporal variations. The map produced is then used as reference to compare the interpolation techniques based on a significantly more sparse measurement set.

The spatial interpolation techniques tested fail in predicting accurately the noise level variations within streets. The explanation given is that they do not offer a sufficient covering of the network, and assume spatial variations which are not coherent with traffic dynamics or street configurations. Inversely, mobile measurements cover the entire network. As a result, they allow a more accurate prediction of noise levels even if very short samples are used, provided that the procedure used to estimate noise levels includes a spatial aggregation, which aims at smoothing the high spatial variations inevitable with short samples. Moreover, mobile measurements can advantageously be used to optimize, through a Genetic Algorithm, the locations where to install fixed stations, promising an efficient noise monitoring at reduced operational costs.

In the first one, the correlation between Ln indexes and green space is presented. In the second level, possible quiet zones are identified using a cluster analysis indicator. At last, the most correlated variables for both cities are identified through Pearson correlation analysis. Results prove that different indicators are prevalent to each city.

abstract = {Measured insertion losses due to the ground effects associated with low configurations of loosely stacked household bricks on a car park are reported. A particularly successful design has the form of a two brick high square lattice which is found to offer a similar insertion loss to regularly-spaced parallel wall arrays of the same height but twice the total width. Part of the insertion loss due to the roughness configurations is the result of transfer of incident sound energy to surface waves which can be reduced by introducing wall absorption or material absorption in the form, for example, of shallow gravel layer. Predicted finite length effects have been explored using a Pseudo-Spectral Time Domain Method, which models the complete 3D roughness profile. It is concluded from measurements and predictions that the lattice design has less dependence on azimuthal source-receiver angle than parallel wall configurations. These predictions are supported by measurements of level difference spectra as a function of azimuthal angle. A 2D Boundary Element Method gives predictions that agree well with data for parallel wall arrays up to 16 m long and it is used to investigate the potential insertion loss of longer configurations up to 0.3 m high. It has been found possible also to make predictions of the insertion loss due to infinitely long 3D lattices using the 2D BEM with the lattice represented by the surface impedance derived from fitting short range data with a slit-pore impedance model. The insertion losses of recessed configurations are predicted to be approximately 3 dB less than those of embossed configurations of the same size. Outdoor experiments also show that pathways can be made through such roughness configurations without significantly affecting their insertion loss. It is concluded that artificial roughness configurations could achieve substantial noise reduction along surface transport corridors without breaking line of sight between source and receiver, thereby proving useful alternatives to noise barriers.},

According to the experimental protocol applied in a previous study carried out in Milan and Naples, binaural recordings in 85 sites and interviews with 266 users of the three parks were performed only during the day in summertime. On the basis of selected acoustical descriptors, the sonic environment of the three parks was categorized and, thanks to statistical analysis, three clusters were identified. The results confirm that the sound environment in urban parks is often considered as "good" or "excellent" even if the sound pressure level is nearly always higher than the limits commonly used to define quiet areas. This is due to the influence of other factors, such as the presence of trees, natural features, and the tranquility; all of these components cannot be neglected in the assessment of the soundscape because they directly affect the psychological state of the person.},

Through a case study, differences between courtyard sound fields were examined by in situ measurements before and after applying a practical landscape design using vegetation, wood decking and street furniture. In addition, computer simulations were carried out to explore the acoustic effects of applicable landscape designs using vegetation including climbing Ivy, green wall, grass and bedding plants. The results for the in situ measurements showed reductions in sound levels and RT20 at 500Hz of 3.1dB and 40{\%} (1.0s), respectively. The results for the computer simulation showed that the green wall on the fa{\c{c}}ade can reduce speech levels and RT20 at 500Hz by 9.3dBA and 81{\%} (2.1s), respectively. The bedding plants on the ground decreased the speech level by 2.2dBA and increased RT at 500Hz by 12{\%} (0.3s). At different floor levels in the accommodation building, the speech level and RT20 at 500Hz were decreased by the vegetation by up to 5.5dBA and 66{\%} (1.1s), respectively.},

Six urban morphological parameters, including Building Plan Area Fraction, Complete Aspect Ratio, Building Surface Area to Plan Area Ratio, Building Frontal Area Index, Height-to-Width Ratio, and Horizontal Distance of First-row Building to Flight Path, have been selected and developed. Effects of flight altitude and horizontal flight path distance to site, on spatial aircraft noise attenuation, are examined, considering open areas and fa{\c{c}}ades. Twenty sampled sites, each of 250m*250m, are considered. The results show that within 1000m horizontal distance of flight path to a site, urban morphology plays an important role in open areas, especially for the buildings with high sound absorption fa{\c{c}}ades, where the variance of average noise level attenuation among different sites is about 4.6dB at 3150Hz. The effect of flight altitude of 200–400ft on average noise level attenuation is not significant, within about 2dB at both 630Hz and1600Hz in open areas. Urban morphological parameters influence the noise attenuation more in open areas than that on fa{\c{c}}ades.

abstract = {To ensure appropriate soundscape management in urban environments, the urban-planning authorities need a range of tools that enable such a task to be performed. An essential step during the management of urban areas from a sound standpoint should be the evaluation of the soundscape in such an area. In this sense, it has been widely acknowledged that a subjective and acoustical categorization of a soundscape is the first step to evaluate it, providing a basis for designing or adapting it to match people's expectations as well. In this sense, this work proposes a model for automatic classification of urban soundscapes. This model is intended for the automatic classification of urban soundscapes based on underlying acoustical and perceptual criteria. Thus, this classification model is proposed to be used as a tool for a comprehensive urban soundscape evaluation. Because of the great complexity associated with the problem, two machine learning techniques, Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Support Vector Machines trained with Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO), are implemented in developing model classification. The results indicate that the SMO model outperforms the SVM model in the specific task of soundscape classification. With the implementation of the SMO algorithm, the classification model achieves an outstanding performance (91.3{\%} of instances correctly classified).},

It is in this context that the proposed methodology can be useful, since it will allow action plans follow up and thus evaluate in a fast and cost effective way the impact of action plans on the population.

The samples are analyzed with a number of existing psychoacoustical parameter algorithmic models. Based on hierarchical cluster and principal components analyses of the calculated results, a series of differences has been shown among different sound types in terms of key psychoacoustical parameters. While different sound categories cannot be identified using any single acoustical and psychoacoustical parameter, identification can be made with a group of parameters, as analyzed with artificial neural networks and discriminant functions in this paper. For artificial neural networks, correlations between network predictions and targets using the average and standard deviation data of psychoacoustical parameters as inputs are above 0.95 for the three natural sound categories and above 0.90 for the urban sound category. For sound identification/classification, key parameters are fluctuation strength, loudness, and sharpness.},

One of the main advantages of the followed approach allows to take into account an optimized set of parameters that are judged relevant and necessary for an appropriate description of the sampled acoustical scenarios. The Euclidian distance based clustering of the 370 recordings of typical situations based on these parameters, allows to categorize each binaurally recorded sound sample into one of 20 proposed clusters (soundscape categories). The common features among members within each cluster allow to identify ‘‘how the acoustical scenario of the mem- bers sounds like''.

The unique sound installation known as the Sea Organ was included as an atypical music-like environment. Typical objective parameters were calculated from the recordings related to the amount of acoustic energy, spectral properties of sound, the amount of fluctuations, and tonal properties. The subjective assessment was done on-site using a common survey for evaluating the properties of sound and visual environment. The results revealed the importance of introducing the context into soundscape research because objective parameters did not show significant correlation with responses obtained from interviewees. Excessive values of certain objective parameters could indicate that a sound environment will be perceived as unpleasant or annoying, but its overall perception depends on how well it agrees with people's expectations. This was clearly seen for the case of Sea Organ for which the highest values of objective parameters were obtained, but, at the same time, it was evaluated as the most positive sound environment in every aspect.},

abstract = {Aircraft noise contours are estimated with model calculations. Due to their impact, e.g., on land use planning, calculations need to be highly accurate, but their uncertainty usually remains unaccounted for. The objective of this study was therefore to quantify the uncertainty of calculated average equivalent continuous sound levels (LAeq) of complex scenarios such as yearly air operations, and to establish uncertainty maps. The methodology was developed for the simulation program FLULA2. In a first step, the partial uncertainties of modelling the aircraft as a sound source and of modelling sound propagation were quantified as a function of aircraft type and distance between aircraft and receiver. Then, these uncertainties were combined for individual flights to obtain the uncertainty of the single event level (LAE) at a specified receiver grid. The average LAeq of a scenario results from the combination of the LAE of many single flights, each of which has its individual uncertainties. In a last step, the uncertainties of all LAE were therefore combined to the uncertainty of the LAeq, accounting also for uncertainties of the number of movements and of prognoses. Uncertainty estimations of FLULA2 calculations for Zurich and Geneva airports revealed that the standard uncertainty of the LAeq ranges from 0.5dB (day) to 1.0dB (night) for past-time scenarios when using radar data as input, and from 1.0dB (day) to 1.3dB (night) for future scenarios, in areas where LAeq⩾53dB (day) and LAeq⩾43dB (night), respectively. Different uncertainty values may result for other models and/or airports, depending on the model sophistication, traffic input data, available sound source data, and airport peculiarities such as the specific aircraft fleet or prevailing departure and arrival procedures. The methodology, while established for FLULA2 on Zurich and Geneva airports, may be applied to other models and/or airports, but the partial uncertainties have to be specifically re-established to account for individual models and underlying sound source data.},

abstract = {We conducted a multi-country study to estimate the perceived economic values of traffic-related air pollution and noise health risks within the framework of a large European project. We used contingent valuation as a method to assess the willingness-to-pay (WTP) for both types of pollutants simultaneously. We asked respondents how much they would be willing to pay annually to avoid certain health risks from specific pollutants. Three sets of vignettes with different levels of information were provided prior to the WTP questions. These vignettes described qualitative general health risks, a quantitative single health risk related to a pollutant, and a quantitative scenario of combined health risks related to a pollutant. The mean WTP estimates to avoid road-traffic air pollution effects for the three vignettes were: €130 per person per year (pp/y) for general health risks, €80 pp/y for a half year shorter in life expectancy, and €330 pp/y to a 50{\%} decrease in road-traffic air pollution. Their medians were €40 pp/y, €10 pp/y and €50 pp/y, respectively. The mean WTP estimates to avoid road-traffic noise effects for the three vignettes were: €90 pp/y for general health risks, €100 pp/y for a 13{\%} increase in severe annoyance, and €320 pp/y for a combined-risk scenario related to an increase of a noise level from 50 dB to 65 dB. Their medians were €20 pp/y, €20 pp/y and €50 pp/y, respectively. Risk perceptions and attitudes as well as environmental and pollutant concerns significantly affected WTP estimates. The observed differences in crude WTP estimates between countries changed considerably when perception-related variables were included in the WTP regression models. For this reason, great care should be taken when performing benefit transfer from studies in one country to another.},

abstract = {A subjective and physical categorization of an ambient sound is the first step to evaluate the soundscape and provides a basis for designing or adapting this ambient sound to match people's expectations. For this reason, the main goal of this work is to develop a categorization and differentiation analysis of soundscapes on the basis of acoustical and perceptual variables. A hierarchical cluster analysis, using 15 semantic-differential attributes and acoustical descriptors to include an equivalent sound-pressure level, maximum-minimum sound-pressure level, impulsiveness of the sound-pressure level, sound-pressure level time course, and spectral composition, was conducted to classify soundscapes into different typologies. This analysis identified 15 different soundscape typologies. Furthermore, based on a discriminant analysis the acoustical descriptors, the crest factor (impulsiveness of the sound-pressure level), and the sound level at 125 Hz were found to be the acoustical variables with the highest impact in the differentiation of the recognized types of soundscapes. Finally, to determine how the different soundscape typologies differed from each other, both subjectively and acoustically, a study was performed.},

abstract = {Urban parks are areas of nature and leisure which should have a favorable acoustic environment.
The quality of this soundscape is not only determined by the equivalent noise level but also by the sounds that visitors walking through the park are likely to notice. To investigate which indicators,
derived from physical measurements, could be used as an indicator for the soundscape quality, a study in 8 urban parks within Antwerp, one of the largest urban areas in Belgium, was conducted.
The study combined a sound measurement campaign and a survey administered to visitors. Contin-
uous, mobile sound recordings were performed with two to three sound recording devices, carried by
researchers performing random walks through the parks. Next to the audio, instantaneous 1/3-octave band levels were logged, as well as instantaneous GPS data, such that the walks could be fully reconstructed afterwards. During the time periods that the measurements were performed, a face-to-face questionnaire survey was conducted among the park visitors, in order to nd out their opinion on various acoustical aspects of the parks. In this paper, rstly, results of the measurement campaign are presented in the form of noise maps. Secondly, a range of acoustical indicators is compared to the individual interview responses using regression analysis. One of these indicators is the noticeabil-
ity of different sounds within the soundscape of each park, calculated using a biologically inspired automated sound recognition model. This validates the methodology for assessing park soundscape quality that is applied in this study.},

Experimental design is also considered with a sensory orientation. The chapter focuses on test strategy as it is applied to the individual request for assistance. The overall goal is to formulate and implement a test plan that will satisfy the stated objective. Specific issues that need to be considered before a plan is completed, and the test implemented are in addition to test priority, objective, and product identification and availability. Test strategy should include the possibility of an initial rejection of a request if the products are inappropriate or the basis for the request cannot be justified. Sensory evaluation uses statistics to determine whether the responses from a group of subjects are sufficiently similar or represent a random occurrence. The chapter also discusses the statistical issues that sensory professionals consider while determining the most appropriate experimental design and analysis for a particular problem.},

abstract = {Auralisation is a process which converts a predicted sound spectrum to an audible format. It has been popularly adopted in the architectural acoustics. The subjective acoustic environment of a building under design can be evaluated by creating a virtual sound. The finding can be fed back to the design process to improve the acoustic quality of the architecture. Hearing a sound is more effective than plotting or tabling acoustic metrics, because human's perception of a sound is never perfectly modelled by numbers. The fundamental methodology of auralisation could be applied to other area of acoustics, where the evaluation of human perception is required. It could be the assessment of the acoustics inside a passenger car or aircraft. It could be the perception by people on the ground when an aircraft flies over. The first part of this paper explains about the 'generic' method of auralisation, which could be applied to noise sources in general. The second half specifically deals with aircraft noise, especially a high bypass-ratio turbofan engine. First of all, the spectrum of engine noise is required to proceed with auralisation. (However, the process itself is not presented.) The predictions are available for several engine components, such as fan, compressor, turbine, jet, and etc. A broadband noise is predicted in the one-third octave-band sound levels. A tonal noise is tabled with discrete frequencies and corresponding sound levels. Each comes with its directivity information. It is first addressed how a stationary sound is generated for engine components. A broadband sound will be treated separately from a tonal sound. To make an audible sound file, the prediction of a spectrum itself is not complete, because it has only amplitude. Therefore, attention is paid to the absence of phase information in the prediction. The auralisation of stationary engine noise itself is useful to evaluate a human response. However, an engine noise is more likely to be perceived when it is in service such as during aircraft flyover. The effect of a moving source needs to be accounted for. In addition, the sound is propagated to an observer on the ground. Its amplitude is reduced while it is spread around. The atmosphere reduces a sound level further depending on the frequency and distance of the propagation. The ground itself also plays a role. It could either attenuate or boost a sound depending on the type of a ground and the source-observer geometry. The effect is also frequency-dependent and hence the final perceived spectrum could be changed.},

abstract = {Many models for the acoustical properties of rigid-porous media require knowledge of parameter values that are not available for outdoor ground surfaces. The relationship used between tortuosity and porosity for stacked spheres results in five characteristic impedance models that require not more than two adjustable parameters. These models and hard-backed-layer versions are considered further through numerical fitting of 42 short range level difference spectra measured over various ground surfaces. For all but eight sites, slit-pore, phenomenological and variable porosity models yield lower fitting errors than those given by the widely used one-parameter semi-empirical model. Data for 12 of 26 grassland sites and for three beech wood sites are fitted better by hard-backed-layer models. Parameter values obtained by fitting slit-pore and phenomenological models to data for relatively low flow resistivity grounds, such as forest floors, porous asphalt, and gravel, are consistent with values that have been obtained non-acoustically. Three impedance models yield reasonable fits to a narrow band excess attenuation spectrum measured at short range over railway ballast but, if extended reaction is taken into account, the hard-backed-layer version of the slit-pore model gives the most reasonable parameter values.},

abstract = {The European Commission today underscored its firm commitment to combating climate change by proposing legislation to bring greenhouse gas emissions from civil aviation into the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS). EU emissions from international air transport are increasing faster than from any other sector. This growth threatens to undermine the EU's progress in cutting overall greenhouse gas emissions. Including civil aviation in the EU ETS is a cost-effective way for the sector to control its emissions and implements an approach endorsed by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). The proposed directive will cover emissions from flights within the EU from 2011 and all flights to and from EU airports from 2012. Both EU and foreign aircraft operators would be covered. Like the industrial companies already covered by the EU ETS, airlines will be able to sell surplus allowances if they reduce their emissions and will need to buy additional allowances if their emissions grow. Any increase in ticket costs resulting from the scheme is expected to be limited, and significantly lower than rises due to oil price changes in recent years.},

abstract = {Noise from cars, trains, and aeroplanes can be heard at large distances from the source. Accurate predictions of the loudness of the noise require accurate computations of sound propagation in the atmosphere. This book describes models that can be used for these computations. The models take into account complex effects of the atmosphere and the ground surface on sound waves, including the effects of wind and temperature distributions, atmospheric turbulence, irregular terrain, and noise barriers. The main text of the book focuses on physical effects in atmospheric acoustics. The effects are illustrated by many numerical examples. The main text requires a very limited mathematical background from the reader; detailed mathematical descriptions of the models, developed from the basic principles of acoustics, are presented in appendices. Models for moving media are compared with models that are based on the effective sound speed approach. Both two-dimensional models and three-dimensional models are presented. As meteorological effects play an important role in atmospheric acoustics, selected topics from boundary layer meteorology and the theory of turbulence are also presented.},

@article{Wunderli2012,
abstract = {In 2010 noise limits for military shooting grounds were introduced into Switzerland. In order to service a noise exposure register and to do action planning, a new calculation model for shooting sound, called sonARMS, was developed. The model will not only be used to assess military but also civil shooting ranges. It is therefore designed to reproduce single event sound exposure levels as well as maximum sound pressure levels. In a weapon database, source strength data are provided for all military weapons used in Switzerland as well as a great number of civil weapons. The sound propagation model has been derived from sonRAIL, a recently developed railway sound calculation model. It is organized into four different modules that are operated independently from each other. The first module is mandatory for each calculation as it performs a calculation of direct sound propagation including ground reflections under the assumption of a homogenous atmosphere. In the second module meteorological effects on sound propagation, most importantly the evolution of acoustical shadow zones and changes in shielding effect, are accounted for. This is achieved by applying a ray tracing procedure that can handle arbitrary gradients with height of the effective sound speed. The third and fourth module yield independent contributions, one for reflections at buildings, walls and other rigid surfaces and one for diffuse reflections at forest edges and cliffs. The algorithms in sonARMS have been optimized for minimal calculation times and allow the preparation of noise maps with a reasonable amount of computational time. {\textcopyright} 2012 Institute of Noise Control Engineering.},

abstract = {The acoustic optimization of flight procedures requires sophisticated models that account for flight configuration parameters as they can have a major influence on the resulting sound exposure. For these purposes a new aircraft noise simulation model, denoted sonAIR, is being developed. Its semi-empirical emission model shall deliver a detailed spectral description of the sound source to account for configuration changes. The aircraft shall be modelled by separate sound sources for engine noise and airframe noise, each featuring different spectra and directivity patterns and possibly being assigned to different locations. As sufficiently detailed sound source data is not available, extensive measurements under real air traffic are planned. In this paper an overview on the sonAIR project is given and the measurement layout is presented. The latter comprises the optimal placement of the microphones in terms of longitudinal and azimuthal emission angles as well as directional uncertainty.},

@article{Ouis2001,
abstract = {In this paper the negative effects resulting from exposure to road traffic noise on people's well being is reviewed in the light of the latest published findings. Annoyance is particularly focused on, which is considered to be one of the first and most widespread reactions to environmental noise. The nonauditory effects of noise on humans are viewed as being generally stress-related, following observations that noise exposures engender physiological reactions typical to those of stress. First, a short presentation is made of what noise in general is. Subsequently, in order to assess some subjective judgements of noise, some of the important noise descriptors, which are often used to quantify various aspects of road traffic noise are introduced. In general terms, it is found from the present review that the continuous exposure of people to road traffic noise leads to suffering from various kinds of discomfort, thus reducing appreciably the number of their well-being elements. Drawing such a conclusion is hindered by difficulties when nonacoustical factors, for instance socio-economic situation, age and gender, are also taken into account along with the usual acoustical factors of road traffic noise. One of people's first and direct reactions to noise is in terms of annoyance. The results of several decades of research on this topic have permitted lately the establishment of a more or less quantitative relationship between the objective quantities characterizing road traffic noise and the human subjective reaction to it as expressed by annoyance. These findings are important at both the society and the individual level, in as much as they may help in regulating in a more efficient way the planning of road traffic activity in order to secure at least the minimum of comfort to the affected population.},

abstract = {The acoustic spectrum emitted by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and other aircraft can be distorted by propagation through atmospheric turbulence. Since most UAVs are propeller-based, they generate a series of acoustic tones and harmonics. In this paper, spectral broadening of these tones due to atmospheric turbulence is studied. The broadening results from the combined Doppler effect of multiply scattered acoustic signals propagating in a non-stationary turbulent atmosphere. It can be assessed as a Fourier transform of the temporal coherence function of a monochromatic signal propagating in an atmosphere with spatial-temporal fluctuations in temperature and wind velocity. This temporal coherence was recently investigated [V. E. Ostashev, D. K. Wilson, S. N. Vecherin, and S. L. Collier, J. Acoust. Soc.

abstract = {A k-space method for large-scale simulation of ultrasonic pulse propagation is presented. The present method, which solves the coupled first-order differential equations for wave propagation in inhomogeneous media, is derived in a simple form analogous to previous finite-difference methods with staggered spatial and temporal grids. Like k-space methods based on second-order wave equations, the present method is exact for homogeneous media, unconditionally stable for "slow" [c(r) {\textless} or = c0] media, and highly accurate for general weakly scattering media. In addition, unlike previous k-space methods, the form of the method allows straightforward inclusion of relaxation absorption and perfectly matched layer (PML) nonreflecting boundary conditions. Numerical examples illustrate the capabilities of the present k-space method. For weakly inhomogeneous media, accurate results are obtained using coarser temporal and spatial steps than possible with comparable finite-difference and pseudospectral methods. The low dispersion of the k-space method allows accurate representation of frequency-dependent attenuation and phase velocity associated with relaxation absorption. A technique for reduction of Gibbs phenomenon artifacts, in which compressibility and exponentially scaled density functions are smoothed by half-band filtering, is introduced. When employed together with this smoothing technique, the k-space method provides high accuracy for media including discontinuities, high-contrast inhomogeneities, and scattering structures smaller than the spatial grid resolution.},

These statistical moments, which are most often of interest, are the following: the variances of log-amplitude and phase fluctuations, the correlation functions of log-amplitude and phase fluctuations, the mean sound field, the coherence function of a sound field, and the sound scattering cross section per unit volume. These statistical moments are calculated for Gaussian spectra of temperature and medium velocityfluctuations. It is shown that the contributions to the statistical moments due to sound scattering by medium velocityfluctuations may dramatically differ from those due to sound scattering by temperaturefluctuations.},

abstract = {Auralization is the process of making audible the acoustics of complex virtual architectural spaces in a realistic and accurate manner. This paper presents a novel real-time auralization software environment comprising a room acoustic modeler, a spatial renderer for auralization, and a visualization and scene graph unit for interactivity. The computation of early reflection paths within the geometric model is based on an efficient beam tracing algorithm capable of real-time detection of specular reflection paths in a static geometry with one or several moving listener(s). For "simple" rooms, the real-time performance is maintained even with dynamic geometries and sources. Results of the room acoustic model consisting of visible reflection paths and their accumulated material attenuation are sent to the audio renderer. From this geometrical and acoustical data, listener position-relative 3D room impulse responses are generated using a higher-order Ambisonics approach. Finally, the spatialized audio output is presented to the listener via multiple loudspeakers or binaurally rendered over headphones. As higher order reflections are more diffuse in nature, they are encoded using lower Ambisonic orders, thereby reducing computational load. The environment combines high quality audio with visual rendering realized using the open source platforms Pure Data and VirChor respectively. This open source auralization framework provides direct audio-visual interaction in real-time and is suitable for VR environments.},

Measurement is critical to quantifying responses to stimuli for the purpose of utilizing descriptive and inferential statistics. Such statistics provide a rational basis for decisions about the products that are evaluated and the subjects who did the evaluations. The value of measurement and the requirement for valid scales of measurement are not unique to sensory evaluation. This chapter classifies measurement scales into four categories—nominal scales for use in classification or naming; ordinal scales for use in ordering or ranking; interval scales for use in measuring magnitudes, assuming equal distances between points on the scale; and ratio scales for use in measuring magnitudes, assuming equality of ratios between points. This chapter also identifies the properties of each scale type along with examples of how they are applied to the sensory evaluation of products. It must be kept in mind that selection of a scale should always occur after a problem has been defined and the objective stated. Suggested methods for analysis according to the specific measurement technique are also listed in this chapter.},

abstract = {Aircraft noise contours are estimated with model calculations. Due to their impact, e.g., on land use planning, calculations need to be highly accurate, but their uncertainty usually remains unaccounted for. The objective of this study was therefore to quantify the uncertainty of calculated average equivalent continuous sound levels (LAeq) of complex scenarios such as yearly air operations, and to establish uncertainty maps. The methodology was developed for the simulation program FLULA2. In a first step, the partial uncertainties of modelling the aircraft as a sound source and of modelling sound propagation were quantified as a function of aircraft type and distance between aircraft and receiver. Then, these uncertainties were combined for individual flights to obtain the uncertainty of the single event level (LAE) at a specified receiver grid. The average LAeq of a scenario results from the combination of the LAE of many single flights, each of which has its individual uncertainties. In a last step, the uncertainties of all LAE were therefore combined to the uncertainty of the LAeq, accounting also for uncertainties of the number of movements and of prognoses. Uncertainty estimations of FLULA2 calculations for Zurich and Geneva airports revealed that the standard uncertainty of the LAeq ranges from 0.5dB (day) to 1.0dB (night) for past-time scenarios when using radar data as input, and from 1.0dB (day) to 1.3dB (night) for future scenarios, in areas where LAeq⩾53dB (day) and LAeq⩾43dB (night), respectively. Different uncertainty values may result for other models and/or airports, depending on the model sophistication, traffic input data, available sound source data, and airport peculiarities such as the specific aircraft fleet or prevailing departure and arrival procedures. The methodology, while established for FLULA2 on Zurich and Geneva airports, may be applied to other models and/or airports, but the partial uncertainties have to be specifically re-established to account for individual models and underlying sound source data.},

This model is based on measurements with a mobile setup in 99 streets in the city of Ghent, Belgium, representative for common European city morphology. The reflection ratio (RR) is used as a parameter to determine the energy contained in the reverberation part of the sound field. The model has been successfully validated by detailed measurements at different source-receiver distances in an urban street canyon.},

Hence the first- and second-order moments are sufficient to predict the heat and momentum flux pdf's.  The lower-order moments can be estimated from mean meteorological conditions using surface layer similarity theory.  For unstable conditions the pdf for temperature is non-Gaussian and is strongly skewed due to local convective thermal plumes.  For near-neutral and stable conditions the pdf's for the velociy and temperature longitudinal gradients have long exponential tails, in agreement with findings in laboratory experiments and numerical simulations.},

The results of this approach were compared with results of a simpler approach which does not consider such changes.

Acoust. Soc. Am. 35, 1056–1058 (1963)] has been extended to allow for partial covariance between the two waves. The theory has been further extended to use the calculations of fluctuations in phase and amplitude of spherical waves, and to include the explicit calculation of the fluctuating acoustical index of refraction from the fluctuating values of temperature and wind velocity.Measurements (1–6 kHz) have been made of the interference spectrum at 15, 30, and 45 m from a point source 1.2 m above a large asphalt surface. Simultaneously, the fluctuating values of temperature and horizontal wind velocity(atmospheric turbulence) were measured at two related points close to the sound path. There is satisfactory quantitative agreement between the sound levels calculated from the measuredfluctuating meteorological variables (with one adjustable parameter) and those measured experimentally.},

In this paper directive sources are implemented in the time-domain method PSTD. First, a given frequency dependent source directivity is decomposed onto spherical harmonic functions. The directive source is then implemented through spatial distributions in PSTD that relate to the spherical harmonic functions, and time-dependent functions are assigned to the spatial distributions in order to obtain the frequency content of the directivity. Since any directivity function can be expressed as a summation of series of spherical harmonics, the approach can be used to model any type of directive source.

abstract = {A theoretical analysis of the acoustic wave field radiated by a time-harmonic point source in a homogeneous, isotropic turbulent medium is presented. The smoothing method is used to study the incoherent, or randomly fluctuating, component of the wave field. The analysis considers the effect on the wave of the velocity fluctuations, as well as the index-of-refraction fluctuations, of the medium. An approximate expression for the second moment of the incoherent wave is obtained for the case in which the wavelenght is much less than the minimum correlation length of the medium. This expression shows that the fluctuations of the wave increase initially in proportion to the propagation distance, but that at larger distances they tend to a limiting, or saturation, value. These results agree with observations of waves propagating in real media. It is also found that the mean square of the total (i.e., coherent plus incoherent) acoustic pressure is unaffected by the randomness of the medium.},

abstract = {Urban optical wireless communication (UOWC) systems are considered a last-mile technology. UOWC systems use the atmosphere as a propagation medium. To provide a line of sight the transceivers are placed on high-rise building. However, dynamic wind loads, thermal expansion, and weak earthquakes cause buildings to sway. These sways distort the alignment between transmitter and receiver, causing pointing errors, the outcome of which is fading of the received signal. Furthermore, atmospheric turbulence causes fluctuations in both the intensity and the phase of the received signal, resulting in impaired link performance. A bit-error probability (BEP) model is developed that takes into account both building sway and turbulence-induced log amplitude fluctuations (i.e., fading of signal intensity) in the regime in which the receiver aperture, D0, is smaller than the turbulence coherence diameter, d0. It is assumed that the receiver has knowledge about the marginal statistics of the signal fading and the instantaneous signal-fading state.},

Spectral measurements in a rigid and an acoustically lined inlet duct have been compared. Also these measurements have been utilized to assess a buzz-saw noise prediction method. The prediction method is based on a one-dimensional nonlinear propagation model. Sound absorption by an acoustic lining can be included in the model. In this article, the buzz-saw noise prediction method is improved by the inclusion in the modelling of the effect of a boundary layer on absorption of sound in a lined duct. Also, modal measurements from a circumferential microphone array have been examined. These show that the principal source of buzz-saw noise is not always the rotor-alone pressure field. Non-rotor-alone scattered tones can be a significant source of buzz-saw noise at low supersonic fan speeds. The numerical simulations, which only predict the rotor-alone tones, have been re-evaluated in light of these new modal measurements.},

abstract = {An extended Fourier pseudospectral time-domain (PSTD) method is presented to model atmospheric sound propagation by solving the linearized Euler equations. In this method, evaluation of spatial derivatives is based on an eigenfunction expansion. Evaluation on a spatial grid requires only two spatial points per wavelength. Time iteration is done using a low-storage optimized six-stage Runge-Kutta method. This method is applied to two-dimensional non-moving media models, one with screens and one for an urban canyon, with generally high accuracy in both amplitude and phase. For a moving atmosphere, accurate results have been obtained in models with both a uniform and a logarithmic wind velocity profile over a rigid ground surface and in the presence of a screen. The method has also been validated for three-dimensional sound propagation over a screen. For that application, the developed method is in the order of 100 times faster than the second-order-accurate FDTD solution to the linearized Euler equations. The method is found to be well suited for atmospheric sound propagation simulations where effects of complex meteorology and straight rigid boundary surfaces are to be investigated.},

abstract = {In October 2014, the first "Joint DLR {\&} TU Delft Aviation Noise Workshop" was or- ganized. This publication is the executive summary of this event. Overall, 38 invited participants from industry, academia, and research institutions have discussed the spe- cific topic of this first 3 day workshop, i.e. "Aircraft Noise Reduction at the Source". The concept of the workshop was to avoid the usual presentation marathon but enable detailed discussions. The invited participants with their various educational, cultural, and working backgrounds have been assigned into work groups to work on specific and predefined tasks. Four specific tasks were formulated in order to address the prob- lem, i.e. (1) identification of main aircraft noise sources on-board of a given reference vehicle, (2) assessment of simulation capabilities for noise prediction, (3) identification and assessment of promising noise reduction concepts for the reference vehicle, and (4) integration of these measures on-board of the reference vehicle. The major noise sources on-board of the reference vehicle as identified by the partici- pants could have been reduced significantly if selected measures are installed on-board. These proposed measures promise to reduce the system noise by 8 dB along a take-off and by 10 dB along an approach flight. Yet, the almost 65{\%} reduction in perceived noise as specified by ACARE's Flight Path 2050 could not be achieved. The most effective measure has been identified as structural shielding of engine noise emission. Overall, the workshop can be understood as the first attempt to establish a new and active network for international cooperation in the field of aircraft noise.},

abstract = {This chapter discusses the organization and operation of a sensory evaluation program. It identifies and characterizes the individual elements that make up a sensory evaluation department in a company. Organizing sensory activities begins with a plan to develop management's awareness of the value of sensory information. The initial step in this process is to develop a written plan, reflecting what has been done, what is being done now and what could be done in the future. Numerous activities were identified, including management-approved goals and objectives, professional staff, program strategy, facilities, test methods, identification, screening and selection of subjects, subject performance monitoring, test requests and reports, data processing, operations manual as well as planning and research. The first step in the process, after identifying the need for sensory resources, is to establish a dialog with management and with potential test requestors that identifies the benefit of sensory program. Matching this expressed need with available resources enables sensory evaluation to develop a realistic plan for the company. This chapter emphasizes on the need for a formal approach to the development of sensory resources to develop a pool of qualified subjects, use procedures that are scientifically sound, document requests and reports, maintain subject performance records, and establish direct lines of communications with technologists and brand managers.},

Based on register information of all persons who have lived in inner Oslo east in five neighbourhood types that differ with respect to road traffic development during the 1990s, it is concluded that there is a pattern of relocation quite consistent with the tipping-point model but only for some groups and in some neighbourhood types. There are more rapid and profound patterns of relocation in neighbourhoods with road traffic increase, than in neighbourhoods with traffic reductions and, in particular, families with children relocate in response to changes in the physical and social characteristics of the neighbourhood.

Through the analysis of a recorded engine noise signal of continuously varying engine speed, a dataset of sound samples is extracted allowing the real time synthesis of the noise induced by arbitrary evolutions of engine speed. The sound samples are extracted from a recording spanning the entire engine speed range. Each sample is delimitated such as to contain the sound emitted during one cycle of the engine plus the necessary overlap to ensure smooth transitions during the synthesis. The proposed approach, an extension of the PSOLA method introduced for speech processing, takes advantage of the specific periodicity of engine noise signals to locate the extraction instants of the sound samples. During the synthesis stage, the sound samples corresponding to the target engine speed evolution are concatenated with an overlap and add algorithm.

abstract = {The coherence function of sound waves propagating through an intermittently turbulent atmosphere is calculated theoretically. Intermittency mechanisms due to both the turbulent energy cascade (intrinsic intermittency) and spatially uneven production (global intermittency) are modeled using ensembles of quasiwavelets (QWs), which are analogous to turbulent eddies. The intrinsic intermittency is associated with decreasing spatial density (packing fraction) of the QWs with decreasing size. Global intermittency is introduced by allowing the local strength of the turbulence, as manifested by the amplitudes of the QWs, to vary in space according to superimposed Markov processes. The resulting turbulence spectrum is then used to evaluate the coherence function of a plane sound wave undergoing line-of-sight propagation. Predictions are made by a general simulation method and by an analytical derivation valid in the limit of Gaussian fluctuations in signal phase. It is shown that the average coherence function increases as a result of both intrinsic and global intermittency. When global intermittency is very strong, signal phase fluctuations become highly non-Gaussian and the average coherence is dominated by episodes with weak turbulence.},

abstract = {We develop a measure for uncertainty about expected stock returns that is derived directly from the well-developed literature on second-order utility: the volatility of option-implied volatility (vol-of-vol). High vol-of-vol stocks signal more of such uncertainty, and robustly underperform low vol-of-vol stocks by 10 percent per year. The vol-of-vol effect is not driven by optimism bias or arbitrage frictions, exposures to jump risk or stochastic volatility risk, or by higher-order risk. Moreover, statistical tests cannot confirm that vol-of-vol is a priced risk factor in traditional asset pricing models. Our results seem inconsistent with rational pricing of uncertainty by a representative agent.},

abstract = {This paper reports on the Zurich Aircraft Noise Index (ZFI), a noise effect index which has been serving noise abatement policy of the canton of Zurich, Switzerland, since 2007. The ZFI is a single number representing a monitoring value for the number of persons affected by aircraft noise in the vicinity of Zurich airport, either by annoyance and/or sleep disturbance. The monitoring value is determined on a yearly basis and compared to a guide value defining the upper limit for the acceptable noise impact on the population. The government of the canton of Zurich takes preventive measures to avoid the guide value to be exceeded. In this paper, the experiences with the ZFI obtained over the years are reviewed. Firstly, the concept and implementation of the ZFI and some key results are presented. Then, the strengths and limitations of the ZFI to assess the aircraft noise effects on the population, as well as the possibility to separate the effects of different influencing parameters using sensitivity analysis are discussed. Finally, measures to reduce the monitoring value are evaluated.},

@article{Brookner1970,
abstract = {The advent of the laser has generated much interest in its use for communication. Consideration is given in this paper to obtaining a communication channel model of the atmosphere for laser frequencies. For this purpose a fairly exhaustive, tutorial, and partly critical review of a major part of the extensive literature pertaining to theoretical and experimental results on the propagation of laser signals in the atmosphere is given. Some of the basic characteristics of the channel for Which detailed results are given are 1) channel time spread (or, equivalently, channel coherence bandwidth) due to multipathing and dispersion, 2) channel gain, 3) channel doppler spread and coherence time, 4) channel spatial coherence and amplitude covariance functions. Consideration is given to both point receivers and area receivers, heterodyne and direct detection receivers, nonplanar (i.e., spherical and beam) wave propagation, and infinite plane-wave propagation. The results are given for clear weather conditions. Brief attention is given to additive noise. In reviewing the extensive literature dealing with the propagation of optical signals through a turbulent medium, an attempt is made to put this varied, diverse, and in some instances controversial material into proper perspective; to note where theoretical results derived for one set of conditions were applied to experimental results obtained for another set of conditions; to correct some invalid conclusions drawn from some theoretical results as far as signal degradation effects and parameter variations; and to indicate where out-of-date vertical profile models were used with updated models being given, and where possible the new theoretical predictions based on these models provided. The paper should, as a result, be of help to those familiar with the literature as Well as those who are not. For those not acquainted with the literature, in addition to providing a fairly in-depth knowledge of the characteristics of propagati- on through a turbulent medium and an indication of the status of our understanding of this subject, the paper should provide a stepping stone for obtaining a more thorough understanding of the subject and for doing work in the field.},

In terms of simplicity of realization and reduction of computational complexity, these algorithms compare favorably with conventional matrix ap- proaches. A filtering interpretation (low-pass filter followed by an exact polynomial spline interpolator) of smoothing spline and least squares approximation methods is proposed. These tech- niques are applied to the design of digital filters for cubic spline signal processing. An efficient implementation of a smoothing spline edge detector is proposed. It is also shown how to con- struct a cubic spline image pyramid that minimizes the loss of information in passage from one resolution level to the next. In terms of common measures of fidelity (e.g., visual quality, SNR), this data structure appears to be superior to the widely used Gaussian/Laplacian pyramid. I.},

abstract = {We present a model of the distribution of noise annoyance with the mean varying as a function of the noise exposure. Day-night level (DNL) and day-evening-night level (DENL) were used as noise descriptors. Because the entire annoyance distribution has been modeled, any annoyance measure that summarizes this distribution can be calculated from the model. We fitted the model to data from noise annoyance studies for aircraft, road traffic, and railways separately. Polynomial approximations of relationships implied by the model for the combinations of the following exposure and annoyance measures are presented: DNL or DENL, and percentage "highly annoyed" (cutoff at 72 on a scale of 0-100), percentage "annoyed" (cutoff at 50 on a scale of 0-100), or percentage (at least) "a little annoyed" (cutoff at 28 on a scale of 0-100). These approximations are very good, and they are easier to use for practical calculations than the model itself, because the model involves a normal distribution. Our results are based on the same data set that was used earlier to establish relationships between DNL and percentage highly annoyed. In this paper we provide better estimates of the confidence intervals due to the improved model of the relationship between annoyance and noise exposure. Moreover, relationships using descriptors other than DNL and percentage highly annoyed, which are presented here, have not been established earlier on the basis of a large dataset.},

Sensory acceptance represents the third and final phase of test resources along with discrimination and descriptive analysis tests. As a resource, it provides continuity between the controlled laboratory environment and the typical product use situation, such as home, restaurant, and so forth. The types of sensory acceptance tests include the laboratory, central location, and home-use. All of these test types follow accepted sensory evaluation procedures and practices. The sensory acceptance test is a very cost-effective resource and plays a major role in the development of successful products. The chapter discusses two methods to measure preference and acceptance—the paired-comparison test and the nine-point hedonic scale. The subjects participating in a sensory acceptance test should be qualified based on typical demographic and usage criteria or preference scores from survey data. The chapter also discusses the relationship between the sensory acceptance and the larger-scale marketing research models, and the role of the sensory acceptance model and its responsibilities in the product evaluation.},

abstract = {The detection of tracks in spectrograms is an important step in remote sensing applications such as the analysis of marine mammal calls and remote sensing data in underwater environments. Recent advances in technology and the abundance of data requires the development of more sensitive detection methods. This problem has attracted researchers' interest from a variety of backgrounds ranging between image processing, signal processing, simulated annealing and Bayesian filtering. Most of the literature is concentrated in three areas: image processing, neural networks, and statistical models such as the Hidden Markov model. There has not been a review paper which describes and critically analyses the application of these key algorithms. This paper presents an extensive survey and an algorithm taxonomy, additionally each algorithm is reviewed according to a set of criteria relating to their success in application. These criteria are defined to be their ability to cope with noise variation over time, track association, high variability in track shape, closely separated tracks, multiple tracks, the birth/death of tracks, low signal-to-noise ratios, that they have no a priori assumption of track shape and that they are computationally cheap. Our analysis concludes that none of these algorithms fully meets these criteria.},

abstract = {Some issues regarding atmospheric turbulence modeling and its role in acoustic scattering calculations are discussed. Discrepancies between turbulence spectral models appearing in the acoustical and in the atmospheric sciences literature are noted, and it is argued that these discrepancies can be understood by recognizing that the acoustic wavelength and scattering geometry combine to act as an “acoustic filter” which selects a specific part of the turbulence spectrum. A particular model spectrum can yield satisfactory acoustic scattering predictions if it fits the actual spectrum well at the acoustically filtered turbulence scales, even if the model is a poor overall representation of the turbulence spectrum. Proper interpretation of length scales determined by fitting two-point correlation functions, and the importance of averaging times in estimating variances, are also discussed in relation to the action of the acoustic filter.},

abstract = {The Fourier pseudospectral time-domain (PSTD) method is an attractive method to efficiently model wave propagation through a weakly inhomogeneous fluid medium. The method fails, however, for fluid media with discontinuous properties. This failure is due to the well known Gibbs phenomenon which arises when Fourier transforming a discontinuous function. The extended Fourier PSTD method developed here can accurately and efficiently model wave propagation through weakly inhomogeneous fluid media with discontinuities in the media properties. Rather than using Fourier transforms to calculate the spatial derivatives in the wave equation, the method developed here uses a generalized eigenfunction expansion for which no Gibbs phenomenon arises. Two approaches to solving the resulting time-domain problem are explored and the accuracy of the method is demonstrated. Finally, results from an example calculation of transmission through the water-air interface are shown. {\textcopyright} 2010 IMACS.},

The test method has evolved in response to a greater appreciation for the perceptual processes involved in the discrimination task. The chapter discusses three types of discrimination tests: paired comparison test, duo–trio test, and triangle test. The paired-comparison test is a two-product test, and the subject's task is to indicate, by circling or by some similar means, the one product that has more of a designated characteristic such as sweetness, tenderness, or shininess, with the designated characteristic having been identified before the test and stated on the scorecard. In duo–trio test, the subject's task is to indicate which product is most similar to the reference and was found to be useful for products that had relatively intense taste, odor, and kinesthetic effects. The triangle test is a three-product test in which all three products are coded and the subject's task is to determine which two are most similar or which one is most different from the other two. The results of discrimination testing have proven effective and have saved companies' substantial amounts of time, money, and effort.},

abstract = {The privatization of major Australian airports in the late 1990s unleashed an unprecedented development wave as corporate lessees implemented ambitious business plans. While planning and environmental regulations governing on-airport development were significantly enhanced, there has been national disquiet about a governance regime that remains under the auspices of the federal government and is not effectively integrated into state and local decision-making machinery. Tensions in major airport regions have been exacerbated by the building of highly conspicuous non-aeronautical developments approved with no determining input by local decision-makers as well as the growing pressures on off-airport locations for aviation-related development. This paper canvasses this context and overviews the evolving structure of planning controls for Australia's privatized federal airports. A range of issues surfacing through the National Aviation Policy Review process in 2008-2009 is described. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Biomedical applications of photoacoustics, in particular photoacoustic tomography, require efficient models of photoacoustic propagation that can incorporate realistic properties of soft tissue, such as acoustic inhomogeneities both for purposes of simulation and for use in model-based image reconstruction methods. k-space methods are well suited to modeling high-frequency acoustics applications as they require fewer mesh points per wavelength than conventional finite element and finite difference models, and larger time steps can be taken without a loss of stability or accuracy. They are also straightforward to encode numerically, making them appealing as a general tool. The rationale behind k-space methods and the k-space approach to the numerical modeling of photoacoustic waves in fluids are covered in this paper. Three existing k-space models are applied to photoacoustics and demonstrated with examples: an exact model for homogeneous media, a second-order model that can take into account heterogeneous media, and a first-order model that can incorporate absorbing boundary conditions.},

These statistical moments, which are most often of interest, are the following: the variances of log-amplitude and phase fluctuations, the correlation functions of log-amplitude and phase fluctuations, the mean sound field, the coherence function of a sound field, and the sound scattering cross section per unit volume. These statistical moments are calculated for Gaussian spectra of temperature and medium velocityfluctuations. It is shown that the contributions to the statistical moments due to sound scattering by medium velocityfluctuations may dramatically differ from those due to sound scattering by temperaturefluctuations.},

Some of the resulting systems substantially differ from the familiar tube and wing designs constituting the current civil transport fleet. This study attempts to explore whether or not the effective perceived noise level metric used in the NASA noise goal accurately reflects human subject response across the range of vehicles considered. Further, it seeks to determine, in a quantitative manner, if the sounds associated with the advanced aircraft are more or less preferable to the reference vehicles beyond any differences revealed by the metric. These explorations are made through psychoacoustic tests in a controlled laboratory environment using simulated stimuli developed from auralizations of selected vehicles based on systems noise assessments.},

abstract = {The paper describes the results of a preparatory study for the planned introduction of a harmonised method to assess long-term sound levels in Europe. The purpose of this study is to quantify the error in the prediction of long-term sound levels when propagation calculations refer to a limited number of between 1 and 121 representative meteorological situations. This error is determined with respect to the average sound level resulting from parabolic-equation simulations for 1452 meteorological situations of consecutive 6-h intervals during one year. The meteorological situations were taken from meteorological tower measurements at Garching near Munich, Germany. The various meteorological conditions enter the model through two-parameter logarithmic–linear vertical profiles of the effective speed of sound which were fitted to the tower measurements. While source power and ground impedance were held constant, the model results elucidate the sound level variations due to the meteorological variability. A spread of 18 dB was found in the calculated instantaneous levels at 200 m range for rigid ground. The spread was 42 dB at 1000 m. Because of the asymmetric frequency distribution of wind directions, a spread of still up to 5.5 dB was found in the calculated annual average levels at 1000 m range for various directions of propagation. As a consequence of the specific meteorological conditions the annual average night-time level exceeds the annual average day-time level by up to 5 dB. Only 25 logarithmic–linear profile classes are necessary to determine the long-term average sound level at 1000 m range with an accuracy better than 2 dB. The use of purely linear profile classes slightly impairs the results, whereas the use of purely logarithmic profile classes cannot be recommended.},

It is stated as a nonconvex and nonlinear control problem governed by ordinary differential equations using a jet noise model. The vertical plan and the space cases have been solved using two approaches, one direct and one indirect. The objective was initially to apply these two methods, then to carry out comparisons, and finally to retain the method which would be applied for the general case including engine and airframe sources. Results showed that the direct method is adapted for solving the problem and can be implemented with moderate computing times. It is sufficient to analyze the constrained flight path optimization of commercial aircraft reducing noise levels. The three-segment approach procedure has been obtained as an optimized flight path which can substantially reduce noise levels. This modified approach procedure has been examined and could benefit both airlines and communities. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Subjective evaluations of noise from proposed aircraft and flight operations can be performed using simulated flyover noise. Such simulations typically involve three components: generation of source noise, propagation of that noise to a receiver on or near the ground, and reproduction of that sound in a subjective test environment. Previous work by the authors focused mainly on development of high-fidelity source noise synthesis techniques and sound reproduction methods while assuming a straight-line propagation path with standard atmospheric absorption and simple (plane-wave) ground reflection models. For aircraft community noise applications, this is usually sufficient because the aircraft are nearly overhead. However, when simulating noise sources at low elevation angles, the plane-wave assumption is no longer valid and must be replaced by a model that takes into account the reflection of spherical waves from a ground surface of finite impedance. Recent additions to the NASA Community Noise Test Environment (CNoTE) software suite have improved real-time simulation capabilities of ground-plane reflections for low incidence angles. The models are presented along with the resulting frequency response of the filters representing excess ground attenuation. Discussion includes an assessment of the performance and limitations of the filters in a real-time simulation.},

abstract = {The first part of this paper is a review of some definitions of noise annoyance which have been used explicitly or implicitly in major files and laboratory studies in different countries. This analysis shows wide differences. For instance, in some cases annoyance is seen as an outcome of disturbances, in other cases it is seen as an indication of the degree of helplessness with respect to the noise source. The second part is a report of an empirical study in which 68 noise research experts from seven different nations were asked (1) to indicate the main effect of noise, and (2) to rate the similarity between the concept “noise annoyance” and several related concepts. It turned out that (1) noise annoyance is seen as the major effect of noise, (2) that noise annoyance is a multi-faceted psychological concept, including behavioral, and evaluative aspects. Also, (3) the two aspects rated highest in similarity to annoyance are “nuisance” and “disturbance”, (4) although noise annoyance must be related to acoustic variables, acoustic characteristics do not play an overwhelming role in the concept of annoyance and (5) although experts from different languages agree upon the main components of the annoyance concept (e.g., nuisance, disturbance, and unpleasantness), there are some significant differences in the weights English, German, and Japanese speaking experts assign to several components (e.g., to nuisance, interference, irritation, and vexation). Whether these different weights are due to different concepts of annoyance, or due to different connotations of the related words in the respective languages, could not be analyzed with the data at hand.},

Current methods for determining the impact of aircraft noise on annoyance and sleep disturbance are based on energetic quantities neglecting the dynamic character of the sound. To obtain a more complete representation of annoyance, it would be helpful to predict the audible aircraft sound and determine the impact of the aircraft sound on people. In a related project at Empa, sonAIR, recordings were made of aircraft taking off and landing. These recordings were made at several positions and with several microphones simultaneously. Combined with cockpit data, flight path information and an inverse sound propagation model, this gives the possibility to determine the emission as function of aircraft conditions and observer angle. An inverse sound propagation model is used to estimate the emission in the time-domain. The obtained signal corresponds to the immission of a microphone flying along with the aircraft and rotating about it. The time-domain approach allows extracting narrowband information like tones and time-dependent variations like modulations.},

Current methods for determining the impact of aircraft noise on annoyance and sleep disturbance are based on energetic quantities disregarding the dynamic character of the sound. To obtain a more complete representation of annoyance, one should predict the audible aircraft sound and determine the impact of the aircraft sound on people. A tool was developed to auralize aircraft noise. The propagation model includes, aside from the typically considered propagation effects like Doppler shift and ground reflection, also amplitude and phase modulations due to atmospheric turbulence. Depending on parameters that are used to describe the atmospheric turbulence, the amplitude modulations result in clearly audible modulations and vertical peaks in a spectrogram. The phase modulations cause additional decorrelation. An inverse propagation model and an automated procedure to extract features to describe aircraft emission was developed. Validation of the features was done through listening tests where listeners were asked to rate both recordings and auralizations based on the extracted features and with the use of the propagation model.},

abstract = {While the technique of auralization has been in use for quite some time in architectural acoustics, the application to environmental noise has been discovered only recently. With road traffic noise being the dominant noise source in most countries, particular interest lies in the synthesis of realistic pass-by sounds. This article describes an auralizator for pass-bys of accelerating passenger cars. The key element is a synthesizer that simulates the acoustical emission of different vehicles, driving on different surfaces, under different operating conditions. Audio signals for the emitted tire noise, as well as the propulsion noise are generated using spectral modeling synthesis, which gives complete control of the signal characteristics. The sound of propulsion is synthesized as a function of instantaneous engine speed, engine load and emission angle, whereas the sound of tires is created in dependence of vehicle speed and emission angle. The sound propagation is simulated by applying a series of time-variant digital filters. To obtain the corresponding steering parameters of the synthesizer, controlled experiments were carried out. The tire noise parameters were determined from coast-by measurements of passenger cars with idling engines. To obtain the propulsion noise parameters, measurements at different engine speeds, engine loads and emission angles were performed using a chassis dynamometer. The article shows how, from the measured data, the synthesizer parameters are calculated using audio signal processing.},

While these activities will bring attention to sensory evaluation, they require a much greater understanding. Sensory professionals cannot expect to be focusing their attention solely on a test, rather as much attention must be given to the basis for a problem, what are the objectives, who will make decisions, and how will they be made, and so forth. Therefore, sensory professionals must make the transition from servicing requests to a direct involvement in the organization and planning process. In describing specific problems, this chapter and emphasizes the planning and organizational aspects of the particular problems and identifies the ways in which sensory evaluation can contribute. The chapter concludes that principles of sensory evaluation do not change, only their applications change. Success depends on the patience, skills, and the knowledge of the sensory professional.},

Many of the results and techniques presented here, while rooted in classic Fourier techniques for signal representation, first ap- peared during a flurry of activity in the 1980s and 1990s. New constructions for local Fourier transforms and orthonormal wavelet bases during that period weremo- tivated both by theoretical interest and by applications, in particular in multimedia communications. New bases with specified time–frequency behavior were found, with impact well beyond the original fields of application. Areas as diverse as com- puter graphics and numerical analysis embraced some of the new constructions—no surprise given the pervasive role of Fourier analysis in science and engineering. Now that the dust has settled, some of what was new and esoteric is now fundamental. Our motivation is to bring these new fundamentals to a broader audience to further expand their impact. We thus provide an integrated view of classical Fourier analysis of signals and systems alongside structured representations with time–frequency locality and their myriad of applications.},

abstract = {Auralization is a term introduced to be used in analogy with visualization to describe rendering audible (imaginary) sound fields. Several modeling methods are available in architectural acoustics for this purpose. If auralization is done by computer modeling, it can be thought of as "true" acoustical computer-aided design. Together with new hardware implementation of signal processing routines, auralization forms the basis of a powerful new technoogy for room simulation and aural event generation. The history, trends, problems, and possibilities of auralization are described. The discussion primarily deals with auralization of auditorium acoustics and loudspeaker installations. The advantages and disadvantages of various approaches are discussed, as are possible testing and verification techniques. The possibility of using acoustic scale models for auralization is also discussed.: Demonstrations of auralizations have been made, but still the technology's ability to reproduce the subjective impression of the audible characteristics of a hall accurately remains to be verified. This limits the credibility of auralization as a design tool, and verification of auralization the foremost problem to be attacked at this time. The verification problem also applies to the basic room impulse response prediction programs. The combination of auralization with transaural reproduction, room equalization, and active noise control could make it possible to expand the applications of the technology beyond the laboratory and beyond simple headphone reproduction. A large number of interesting applications outside the room and psychoacoustics reearch are conceivable, the most interesting of which are probably its use in information, education, and entertainment.},

abstract = {Line-of-sight measurements of the log-amplitude and phase fluctuations of pure tones between 250 and 4000 Hz propagated over distances between 2 and 300 m in the turbulent atmosphere close to the ground are compared quantitatively with simple theory using simultaneously measured meteorological variables. The theory is based on the assumption of homogeneous and isotropic turbulence and approximates the availability of eddy sizes in the source region of turbulence by a Gaussian spectrum. In particular, the transverse or mutual coherence function and the coherence in the direction of propagation (longitudinal coherence) are also calculated and compared with the measurements. When the measured mean square phase fluctuations are compared with the theory using the meteorological measurements, good agreement is obtained. However the measured mean square log-amplitude fluctuations are in general substantially smaller than predicted and, in addition, show clear evidence of saturation. The distance to saturation is shown to correspond to the longitudinal coherence length. Because of this behavior of the amplitude fluctuations, both the transverse and longitudinal coherences are essentially a function of the phase variance only.},

The major interest is in the optical to millimeter wavelength range where fluctuations in amplitude, phase, and angle-of-arrival are important system considerations. It is assumed that the fluctuations are the result of variations in the refractive index caused by turbulence in the atmosphere. The review concentrates on the major approximations involved in the theoretical developments, and in particular, attempts to put in perspective the arguments over Rytov's method. The paper includes a number of previously untranslated results from the Russian literature, and some previously unpublished results of the author's.

By modifying the direct ray contribution relative to the ground reflected ray, using filters, the coherence loss effect can be included in a propagation scheme. The results of this approach match with the theoretical predictions thereby verifying the ability of the method. Furthermore, the modulation of aircraft tonal components, due to changing ground interference during a flyover, is diminished as a result of the proposed method. Application to an auralization and comparing to a measurement shows that auralizations can benefit from this method. Therefore the current method forms an essential addition to the techniques currently used in the auralization of aircraft noise.},

For evaluating annoyance of new procedures, different aircraft types or changing atmospheric conditions, a new modelling approach is necessary. A research effort has been initiated to develop a toolchain that links each of the relevant components. This allows the use of synthesized sound in a virtual reality simulator and enhances follow-up annoyance investigations. The toolchain components and current capabilities are presented in this paper. Audible results are illustrated by spectrograms to show the difference between different atmospheric conditions. Through the development of the toolchain, it becomes possible to demonstrate audible results of changing aircraft procedures, type and atmosphere in a virtual reality environment. This opens new ways to investigate how people value aircraft noise in different atmospheres in combination with smart planning of aircraft procedures.},

The book describes the relationships between the characteristics of the sounds that enter the ear and the sensations that they produce. Wherever possible these relationships are specified in terms of the underlying mechanisms. In other words, the goal is to impart an understanding of what the auditory system does and how it works. Topics covered include the physics of sound, the physiology of the auditory system, frequency selectivity and masking, loudness perception, temporal analysis, pitch perception, sound localization, timbre perception, the perceptual organization of complex auditory "scenes", speech perception, and practical applications such as hearing aids, cochlear implants, and high-fidelity sound reproduction. The book starts from basic principles, and does not assume prior knowledge about hearing. Research results are not just described, but are interpreted and evaluated. The book includes extensive references to recent research so that those interested in a specific area can readily obtain more detailed information.Designed for advanced undergraduate and graduate level courses in psychology, speech and hearing sciences, and audiologyWill appeal to researchers and professionals involved in sound and hearing, such as audio engineers, otologists, hearing-aid designers, audiologists, and hearing aid dispensersEmphasis on the mechanisms underlying auditory perception with key concepts clearly explained},

abstract = {When constructing a tyre, it is of importance that improvements and planned changes are not only physically measurable, but that they also can be perceived by a listener. Tyre/road noise becomes a more important focus area, especially with the growing market of electric vehicles. In the design of tyre/road sound, there are three main aims: to reduce the overall sound level, to increase pleasantness and to do so still maintaining the carried information about e.g. driving conditions. To be able to do this, an understanding of how physical changes in a tyre are reflected in the perception of the same tyre is essential. In the present study, the aim is thus to determine if the rolling noise of a tyre can be both differentiated and characterized by its perceptual qualities. The focus is on the perception of the sound outside the car, perceived by, for example, a pedestrian. Listeners have judged different road tyre combinations and their perception in terms of their emotional responses (pleasantness, activation and stress) and their psychoacoustic responses (loudnes s, sharpness, roughness, and pitch). The results confirmed that rolling noise can be perceptually differentiated. Further, it is possible to differentiate between the effects of the street and the effects of the tyre on all emotional and most psychoacoustic parameters. The results suggest that changes to both road surfaces and tyres can affect both emotional and psychoacoustic perceptual qualities. {\textcopyright} 2016 S. Hirzel Verlag {\textperiodcentered} EAA.},

The method may therefore be used to better understand the scattering mechanisms in operation and may eventually provide a numerical test-bed for developing improved SODAR signals and post-processing algorithms. The method combines an analytical incident sound model with a k-space model of the scattered sound close to the inhomogeneous region and a near-to-far-field transform to obtain far-field scattering patterns. Results from two test case atmospheres are presented: one with periodic temperature fluctuations with height and one with stochastic temperature fluctuations given by the Kolmogorov spectrum. Good agreement is seen with theoretically predicted far-field scattering and the implications for multi-frequency SODAR design are discussed.},

abstract = {This paper describes a set of efficient filtering techniques for the processing and representation of signals in terms of continuous B-spline basis functions. We first consider the problem of determining the spline coefficients for an exact signal interpolation (direct B-spline transform). The reverse operation is the signal reconstruction from its spline coefficients with an optional zooming factor m (indirect B-spline transform). We derive general expressions for the z transforms and the equivalent continuous impulse responses of B-spline interpolators of order n. We present simple techniques for signal differentiation and filtering in the transformed domain. We then derive recursive filters that efficiently solve the problems of smoothing spline and least squares approximations. The smoothing spline technique approximates a signal with a complete set of coefficients subject to certain regularization or smoothness constraints. The least squares approach, on the other hand, uses a reduced number of B-spline coefficients with equally spaced nodes; this techniques is in many ways analogous to the application of antialiasing low-pass filter prior to decimation in order to represent a signal correctly with a reduced number of samples.},

This technique is intended to be used to increase the residents' acceptance of aircraft noise by presenting noise changes in a more directly relatable form, and also aid in understanding what contributes to the residents' subjective annoyance via psychoacoustic surveys. This paper describes the technique as well as some of its initial applications. The reasoning behind the development of such a technique is that the issue of aircraft noise experienced by residents in airport vicinities is one of subjective annoyance. Any efforts at noise abatement have been conventionally presented to residents in terms of noise level reductions in conventional metrics such as A-weighted level or equivalent sound level Leq. This conventional approach however proves insufficient in increasing aircraft noise acceptance due to two main reasons – firstly, the residents have only a rudimentary understanding of changes in decibel and secondly, the conventional metrics do not fully capture what the residents actually find annoying i.e. characteristics of aircraft noise they find least acceptable. In order to allow least resistance to air-traffic expansion, the acceptance of aircraft noise has to be increased, for which such a new approach to noise assessment is required.},

abstract = {In October 2014, the first ”Joint DLR {\&} TU Delft Aviation Noise Workshop” was organized. This publication is the executive summary of this event. Overall, 38 invited participants from industry, academia, and research institutions have discussed the specific topic of this first 3 day workshop, i.e ”Aircraft Noise Reduction at the Source”. Four specific tasks were formulated in order to address the problem, i.e. (1) identification of main aircraft noise sources on-board of a given reference vehicle, (2) assessment of simulation capabilities for noise prediction, (3) identification and assessment of promising noise reduction concepts for the reference vehicle, and (4) integration of these measures on-board of the reference vehicle. The major noise sources on-board of the reference vehicle as identified by the participants could have been reduced significantly if selected measures are installed on-board. These proposed measures promise to reduce the system noise by 8 dB along a take-off and by 10 dB along an approach flight. Yet, the almost 65{\%} reduction in perceived noise as specified by ACARE's Flight Path 2050 could not be achieved. The most effective measure has been identified as structural shielding of engine noise emission.},

abstract = {Large-scale simulation of ultrasonic pulse propagation in inhomogeneous tissue is important for the study of ultrasound-tissue interaction as well as for development of new imaging methods. Typical scales of interest span hundreds of wavelengths; most current two-dimensional methods, such as finite-difference and finite-element methods, are unable to compute propagation on this scale with the efficiency needed for imaging studies. Furthermore, for most available methods of simulating ultrasonic propagation, large-scale, three-dimensional computations of ultrasonic scattering are infeasible. Some of these difficulties have been overcome by previous pseudospectral and k-space methods, which allow substantial portions of the necessary computations to be executed using fast Fourier transforms. This paper presents a simplified derivation of the k-space method for a medium of variable sound speed and density; the derivation clearly shows the relationship of this k-space method to both past k-space methods and pseudospectral methods. In the present method, the spatial differential equations are solved by a simple Fourier transform method, and temporal iteration is performed using a k-t space propagator. The temporal iteration procedure is shown to be exact for homogeneous media, unconditionally stable for "slow" (c(x) {\textless} or = c0) media, and highly accurate for general weakly scattering media. The applicability of the k-space method to large-scale soft tissue modeling is shown by simulating two-dimensional propagation of an incident plane wave through several tissue-mimicking cylinders as well as a model chest wall cross section. A three-dimensional implementation of the k-space method is also employed for the example problem of propagation through a tissue-mimicking sphere. Numerical results indicate that the k-space method is accurate for large-scale soft tissue computations with much greater efficiency than that of an analogous leapfrog pseudospectral method or a 2-4 finite difference time-domain method. However, numerical results also indicate that the k-space method is less accurate than the finite-difference method for a high contrast scatterer with bone-like properties, although qualitative results can still be obtained by the k-space method with high efficiency. Possible extensions to the method, including representation of absorption effects, absorbing boundary conditions, elastic-wave propagation, and acoustic nonlinearity, are discussed.},

abstract = {The “Galileo Galilei” airport is a civil and military airport quite close to central Pisa. Although the airport brings benefits in terms of tourism and different types of income, the air traffic growth exacerbates the exposition to aircraft noise. This could significantly affect public health. To this day, a small number of studies takes into account the standard indicators of Europe by considering noise emission data for military aircrafts. We estimated the noise impact produced by the airport and we evaluated the related exposed population by using the Integrated Noise Model (INM). The noise power levels of both commercial and military flights have been considered as an input to the model. Predicted levels were validated by means of a noise-monitoring network. A new tracking system (AirNav Radar) that captures Automatic Identification System (AIS) signals emitted by each aircraft has been used to emulate takeoff and landing procedures. This improves the accuracy of the input to the model. We simulated noise maps for present and future scenarios, including those following the application of noise reduction measures. For each situation, we also estimated the exposure of the population and the percentages of highly annoyed and highly sleep disturbed people. We show the utility of AIS data and their specific elaboration to draw up noise abatement measures in order to reduce the noise impact on population and allow the airport development.},

@phdthesis{Hoffmann2016,
abstract = {Due to improvements in combustion engines and electric engines for cars, tyre noise has become the prominent noise source at low and medium speeds. Models exist that simulate the noise produced by a rolling tyre, as do models that auralize specific traffic situations from a basic data set. A model that combines both could assist in the planning stage of a tyre by delivering not only estimates of the physical behaviour of the tyre, but also by further making the resulting sound perceivable. Further, such a model could help to design acoustic traffic situations with full control of all parameters. Focusing on that, this thesis has three aims. All focus is on the perception of the sound of a car from the outside, perceived by, for example, a pedestrian. The first aim is to combine an established model for tyre noise (SPERoN) with an auralization tool. The combined model can predict the spectrum of a car pass-by at 7.5 m, as well as reproduce the sound at a given listener position. Psychoacoustic judgements are used to compare the modelled signals with recorded signals. It was found that responses for simulated and recorded signals correlated for all cases, but the ranked orders differed slightly. The second aim focuses on the perception of tyre–road noise and whether it can be differentiated and characterized by its perceptual qualities. When designing tyre sounds, the main aim should be to increase the pleasantness of the total vehicle sound while maintaining the carried information and reducing the sound level. Achieving this requires an understanding of how physical changes in a tyre are reflected in the perception of that tyre. Listeners were asked to judge different tyre–road combinations and their perception in terms of their emotional and psychoacoustic responses. The results confirmed that rolling noise can be perceptually differentiated. The third aim in this thesis was to increase understanding of the parameters that influence the detection of a single car in background traffic noise. For this, both variations in the sound of the test car and in the background (e.g. distance, traffic amount, speed, tyre/engine noise) were investigated and found to influence the reaction time. The introduced auralization method was utilized to generate the sound files for the different traffic situations.{\textless}br /{\textgreater}{\textless}br /{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Landscape pattern has long been hypothesized to influence automobile dependency. Because choices about land development tend to have long-lasting impacts that span over decades, understanding the magnitude of this influence is critical to the design of policies to reduce emissions and other negative externalities associated with car use. Combining household survey data from Germany with satellite imagery and other geo-referenced data sources, we undertake an econometric analysis of the relation between landscape pattern and automobile dependency. Specifically, we employ a two-part model to investigate two dimensions of car use, the discrete decision to own a car and, conditional upon ownership, the continuous decision of how far to drive. Results indicate that landscape pattern, as captured by measures of both land cover (e.g. the extent of open space and landscape diversity) and land use (e.g. the density of regional businesses) are important predictors of car ownership and use. Other policy-relevant variables, such as fuel prices and public transit infrastructure, are also identified as correlates. Based on the magnitude of our estimates, we conclude that carefully considered land development and zoning measures – ones that encourage dense development, diverse land cover and mixed land use – can have beneficial impacts in reducing car dependency that extend far into the future.},

Based on the successes of sensory evaluation in food and nonfood applications, it is clear that the information contributes to a product's information base and thus contributes to that company's profits. However, the success of a sensory program requires a commitment from that company's management, a commitment to support a program that offers a full range of services, has the flexibility to respond rapidly to changes in the marketplace, evaluate new methodologies, and be able to respond to shifts in product categories because of changing business plans and strategies. Successful sensory programs require time to develop, regardless of company size. The chapter discusses various problems that are frequently encountered by sensory professionals. This chapter closes with the bright future of sensory evaluation. If sensory evaluation is to become more successful, it must move from a passive, service-oriented program to an active, results-oriented resource. The sensory professional must not only acquire new knowledge but also must educate others about the science.},

The mean sound field, the coherence functions of plane and spherical waves and their coherence radii in such a medium are calculated analytically and numerically. It is found that the temperature and medium velocity contributions to these statistical moments of a sound field may differ significantly. The coherence functions of plane and spherical waves for the von Karman spectrum of medium inhomogeneities have been compared with those for the Kolmogorov and Gaussian spectra. The latter two spectra have been used widely in theories of sound propagation in random media. It is shown that, in limiting cases, the coherence functions calculated for the von Karman spectrum coincide with those calculated for the Kolmogorov and Gaussian spectra. This result supports the use of the Gaussian spectrum in theories of sound propagation in random media. {\textcopyright} 1998 Acoustical Society of America. S0001-49669800308-7},

abstract = {It is agreed by all involved in planning and designing urban areas that the visual appearance of cities crucially determines the sense of living there and thus needs careful planning efforts. In con- trast to this, the acoustic appearance, i.e. the sound of urban areas has not been able to attract comparable planning efforts yet. Regardless whether this is seen as a consequence of insufficient predictability or of underrated relevance of sounds, it regularly ends up with involving acousti- cians and sound planners too late, thus making efficient sound planning and design unnecessarily difficult or even impossible. The dimension of this lack can be illustrated by imagining the contrary vision. We might have an implementable plan how an area would sound in the future, avoiding bad surprises and assuring efficient use of resources. We could protect restorative areas for the people's well-being and we could avoid hot spots where otherwise we had to cope with unhealthy noise exposure afterwards. Today we are far from this vision and the normal situation is that we are happy if we can manage the most relevant problems. The Urban Sound Planner project SONORUS is an integrated training network (ITN) financed by the EC for a period of four years and coordinated by Chalmers University of Gothenburg in Swe- den. Nine partners from all over Europe participate in this training network to educate 14 young researchers in urban sound planning. At the end we hope to have young people who master the whole range of tools from proven noise control technologies to soundscape approaches. However, to make an impact, they also have to understand city planning and possess very good skills in team building and communication. During their education they will have the opportunity to train theses skills on test sites in Antwerp, Brighton, Gothenburg, Rome and Rotterdam.},

abstract = {This chapter deals with the descriptive analysis, which is the most sophisticated concept in the sensory analysis of products. Descriptive methods were designed to analyze products with a high degree of reliability and precision. Results from a descriptive analysis test provide complete sensory descriptions of an array of products, the basis for mapping product similarities and differences, and a basis for determining sensory attributes. The chapter classifies six test methods for descriptive analysis, according to whether the results are qualitative or quantitative. The test methods described in the chapter are: flavor profile, texture profile, quantitative descriptive analysis (QDA method), spectrum descriptive analysis, free-choice profiling, and diagnostic descriptive analysis. The development of the methodology has been traced from the use of a product expert through the more formal and rigorous approach applied in the QDA method. The QDA methodology emphasizes on the behavioral basis of the judgment process and combines with a rigorous approach to assess response reliability.},

abstract = {A study was conducted to examine the influence of changes in tonalness on annoyance ratings of aircraft noise. Stimuli used in this study were simulated using a program in which aircraft noise was decomposed into noise and tonal components. From these base components, additional aircraft sounds were created by varying the amplitude of the tonal components in a controlled manner while leaving the other sound attributes relatively unaffected. Two sets of 11 stimuli were generated based on a recording of a flyover after take-off event of an Airbus-310 aircraft. In Set A, tonalness was varied while loudness was kept nearly constant. In Set B, both tonalness and loudness were varied. Forty subjects aged between 19 to 33 years from a university population were recruited for this test. In the test, subjects rated the two sets of stimuli on an annoyance scale. Tonalness of these sounds, as predicted by using Aures' Tonality model, ranged from 0.01 to 0.40. The range was little broader than the range we found in a set of around 40 aircraft recordings around two Florida airports. Many of the subjects were found to be sensitive to tonalness changes. In Set A when only the tonalness was increased, a significant increase in annoyance ratings was observed. It was also found that the loudness influenced the annoyance ratings significantly, when both tonalness and loudness were varied, but that tonalness still influenced the ratings. Average annoyance ratings were highly correlated to metrics that take into account both tonalness and level. It appears from the results that inclusion of tonalness in environmental noise metrics should be considered, but that large-scale community surveys including noise measurements should be conducted to determine the form that the tonalness-level metric should take.},

QWs are convenient for representing random fields with a self-similar structure. In this paper, a general, multi-dimensional treatment of QW fields is presented that includes scale-dependence in the number density and amplitude of the QWs. Previous QW formulations are extended to include anisotropy and correlations among several properties of the random fields. These extensions would be difficult (if not impossible) to achieve systematically by Fourier methods. As an example application, it is shown how QW models can be constructed to produce constant turbulent flux layers. Heat flux in buoyantly driven turbulence is modeled as a collection of QWs with predominantly horizontal rotation coupled with dipole scalar perturbations. Predictions for spectra in the presence of fluxes are obtained.},

For this reason, numerous studies are dedicated to the understanding of the relation between the acoustic characteristics of the flyover sound and the auditory sensations they provoke. Here is presented a method of sound simulation allowing manufacturers and researchers to create and listen to realistic binaural sound signals on the basis of a simple description of sources, trajectories and environment. The source is defined as a collection of noise and tonal components. Propagation (atmospheric absorption, geometrical spreading, Doppler effect, ground reflection, turbulence) is modeled under simplifying hypotheses. Binaural sound synthesis is realized with an additive method and Head-Related Transfer Functions, which are adapted in real-time according to headtracking data. This method was successfully used in a collaborative scientific project dealing with the influence of spectro-temporal aspects of flyover sound on listeners' unpleasantness. I.},

abstract = {The atmosphere modifies the emitted sound waves of an aircraft during propagation and is therefore important in the calculation of noise contours or synthesis. Noise contours present the resulting noise levels on the ground and are, as such, often applied for regulatory purposes. Aircraft noise synthesis is a technique that allows to transform a calculated prediction into audible sound that can be experienced in a virtual reality environment. Noise synthesis techniques allow people to be subjected to aircraft, routes or procedures that are still being designed. This dissertation describes recent research to improve the modeling of atmospheric propagation effects in aircraft noise contours as well as aircraft noise synthesis. Multi-event noise contours are usually calculated with standardized models that take non-standard propagation into account in an empirical fashion. A propagation algorithm was developed to augment such a model. Signal processing steps can be applied to transform a source noise prediction into an audible result. Furthermore, such steps can be utilized to apply propagation effects to a source noise signal. For a non-standard atmosphere this is not trivial. The role of a non-standard atmosphere is described by a dedicated simulation framework developed in this dissertation. The framework is applied to a flyover to demonstrate the effects associated with multiple ray paths and shadow zones. Besides demonstrating non-standard atmospheric effects, the framework was used to create synthesized results of actual flyovers near an airport. Subsequently, a comparison between measured results and synthesized results was executed. Furthermore, a method was designed to include the effect of turbulence-induced coherence loss of the direct and ground reflected ray in noise synthesis.},

This article describes the impact of such uncertainties, and how they can be efficiently addressed and quantified with stochastic sampling techniques such as Monte Carlo and Latin hypercube sampling (LHS). Extensions to these techniques, such as importance sampling based on simpler, more efficient propagation models, and adaptive importance sampling, are described. A relatively simple example problem involving the Lloyd{\&}apos;s mirror effect for an elevated sound source in a homogeneous atmosphere is considered first, followed by a more complicated example involving near-ground sound propagation with refraction and scattering by turbulence. When uncertainties in the atmospheric and ground properties dominate, LHS with importance sampling is found to converge to an accurate estimate with the fewest samples. When random turbulent scattering dominates, the sampling method has little impact. A comprehensive computational approach is demonstrated that is both efficient and accurate, while simultaneously incorporating broadband sources, turbulent scattering, and uncertainty in the environmental properties.},

abstract = {All aircraft noise calculation programs need a data base on aircraft sound emission. The time-step program FLULA2 used in Switzerland requires directivity information not available in the Noise-Power-Distance tables (NPD) used in many programs. Thus, an independent data base has been established for a great number of aircraft types on the basis of measurements in the close vicinity of airports. This measurement procedure has proven to yield accurate and reliable departure (initial climb) and final approach directivities. However, changes in flight configuration, i.e., aeroplane configuration plus flight parameters such as power setting, taking place during different stages of flight are modelled so far with relatively rudimentary overall sound level differences. In this paper a brief review of the state of the art of aircraft noise measurements and analysis is given for two- or three-dimensional sound source data. On the basis of typical results, advantages and limitations of the existing acquisition process for sound source data used in Switzerland are discussed and requirements for measurement procedures for next generation aircraft sound source models are identified. Based on these considerations a concept to derive spectral three-dimensional sound directivity patterns in dependence of flight configuration is presented. {\textcopyright} European Acoustics Association.},

In the present paper, line-of-sight sound propagation through inhomogeneous, anisotropicturbulence with temperature and velocity fluctuations is considered. Starting from a parabolic equation and using the Markov approximation, formulas are derived for the correlation functions and variances of log-amplitude and phase fluctuations of a spherical sound wave. These statistical moments of a sound field are important for many practical applications in atmospheric acoustics. The derived formulas for the correlation functions and variances generalize those already known in the literature for two limiting cases: (a) homogeneous, isotropic turbulence, and (b) inhomogeneous, anisotropicturbulence with temperature fluctuations only. Furthermore, the formulas differ from those for the case of plane wave propagation. Using the derived formulas and Mann's spectral tensor of velocity fluctuations for shear-driven turbulence, the correlation functions and variances of log-amplitude and phase fluctuations are studied numerically. The results obtained clearly show that turbulence inhomogeneity and anisotropy significantly affect sound propagation in the atmosphere.},

The information derived from experiments with the senses has a major influence on test procedures and on the measurement of human responses to stimuli. Sensory information is used as a part of marketing decision to identify and quantitatively model the key drivers for a product's acceptance, and is now generally recognized as a core resource for any sensory program.},

abstract = {The NASA Environmentally Responsible Aviation project has been successful in developing and demonstrating technologies for integrated aircraft systems that can simultaneously meet aggressive goals for fuel burn, noise and emissions. Some of the resulting systems substantially differ from the familiar tube and wing designs constituting the current civil transport fleet. This study attempts to explore whether or not the effective perceived noise level metric used in the NASA noise goal accurately reflects human subject response across the range of vehicles considered. Further, it seeks to determine, in a quantitative manner, if the sounds associated with the advanced aircraft are more or less preferable to the reference vehicles beyond any differences revealed by the metric. These explorations are made through psychoacoustic tests in a controlled laboratory environment using simulated stimuli developed from auralizations of selected vehicles based on systems noise assessments. d},

abstract = {The interference of the direct wave from the point source to the receiver and the wave reflected from the impedance ground in a turbulent atmosphere is studied. A parabolic equation approach for calculating the sound pressure p at the receiver is formulated. Then, the parabolic equation is solved by the Rytov method yielding expressions for the complex phases of direct and ground-reflected waves. Using these expressions, a formula for the mean squared sound pressure {\textless}|p|2{\textgreater} is derived for the case of anisotropic spectra of temperature and wind velocity fluctuations. This formula contains the "coherence factor," which characterizes the coherence between direct and ground-reflected waves. It is shown that the coherence factor is equal to the normalized coherence function of a spherical sound wave for line-of-sight propagation. For the case of isotropic turbulence, this result allows one to obtain analytical formulas for {\textless}|p|2{\textgreater} for the Kolmogorov, Gaussian, and von Karman spectra of temperature and wind velocity fluctuations. Using these formulas, the effects of temperature and wind velocity fluctuations, and the effects of different spectra of these fluctuations on the mean squared sound pressure, are numerically studied. Also the effect of turbulent anisotropy on the interference of direct and ground reflected waves is numerically studied. Finally, it is shown that the mean squared sound pressure {\textless}|p|2{\textgreater} calculated for the von Karman spectrum of temperature fluctuations agrees well with experimental data obtained in a laboratory experiment.},

A distinction was made between the annoyance during the day and during the night. Lden and Lnight were considered as indicators of noise exposure. Pooled data analyses showed clear exposure-response relationships between the noise level and the noise annoyance for both exposures. The exposure-response curves for road noise were congruent with the EU standard curves used for predicting the number of highly noise annoyed subjects in European communities. Annoyance ratings due to aircraft noise, however, were higher than predicted by the EU standard curves. The data supports other findings suggesting that the people's attitude towards aircraft noise has changed over the years, and that the EU standard curve for aircraft noise should be modified. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Aircraft noise-induced sleep disturbance ?AN-ISD? is potentially among the more serious effects of aircraft noise on people. This literature review of recent field studies of AN-ISD finds that reliable generalization of findings to population-level effects is complicated by individual differences among subjects, methodological and analytic differences among studies, and predictive relationships that account for only a small fraction of the variance in the relationship between noise exposure and sleep disturbance. It is nonetheless apparent in the studied circumstances of residential exposure that sleep disturbance effects of nighttime aircraft noise intrusions are not dramatic on a per-event basis, and that linkages between outdoor aircraft noise exposure and sleep disturbance are tenuous. It is also apparent that AN-ISD occurs more often during later than earlier parts of the night; that indoor sound levels are more closely associated with sleep disturbance than outdoor measures; and that spontaneous awakenings, or awakenings attributable to nonaircraft indoor noises, occur more often than awakenings attributed to aircraft noise. Predictions of sleep disturbance due to aircraft noise should not be based on over-simplifications of the findings of the reviewed studies, and these reports should be treated with caution in developing regulatory policy for aircraft noise},

abstract = {The mean sound levels resulting from the interference between direct waves and those reflected from the ground are strongly influenced, especially at frequencies near interference minima, by fluctuations in phase and amplitude of the soundwaves induced by propagation through atmospheric turbulence. Since it was found experimentally that the correlation length (∠1.1 m) of the meteorological fluctuations is comparable to the separation between the interfering sound paths, previous theoretical work by Ingard and Maling [J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 35, 1056–1058 (1963)] has been extended to allow for partial covariance between the two waves. The theory has been further extended to use the calculations of fluctuations in phase and amplitude of spherical waves, and to include the explicit calculation of the fluctuating acoustical index of refraction from the fluctuating values of temperature and wind velocity.Measurements (1–6 kHz) have been made of the interference spectrum at 15, 30, and 45 m from a point source 1.2 m above a large asphalt surface. Simultaneously, the fluctuating values of temperature and horizontal wind velocity(atmospheric turbulence) were measured at two related points close to the sound path. There is satisfactory quantitative agreement between the sound levels calculated from the measuredfluctuating meteorological variables (with one adjustable parameter) and those measured experimentally.},

More particularly, the use of complex cepstrum for source-tract deconvolution has been discussed in various articles. However there exists no study which proposes a glottal flow estimation methodology based on cepstrum and reports effective results. In this paper, we show that complex cepstrum can be effectively used for glottal flow estimation by separating the causal and anticausal components of a windowed speech signal as done by the Zeros of the Z-Transform (ZZT) decomposition. Based on exactly the same principles presented for ZZT decomposition, windowing should be applied such that the windowed speech signals exhibit mixed-phase characteristics which conform the speech production model that the anticausal component is mainly due to the glottal flow open phase. The advantage of the complex cepstrum-based approach compared to the ZZT decomposition is its much higher speed.},

abstract = {Mapping of road traffic noise in urban areas according to standardized engineering calculation methods systematically results in an underestimation of noise levels at areas shielded from direct exposure to noise, such as inner yards. In most engineering methods, road traffic lanes are represented by point sources and noise levels are computed utilizing point-to-point propagation paths. For a better prediction of noise levels in shielded urban areas, an extension of engineering methods by an attenuation term A can has been proposed, including multiple reflections of the urban environment both in the source and in the receiver area. The present work has two main contributions for the ease of computing A can. Firstly, it is shown by numerical calculations that A can may be divided into independent source and receiver environment terms, A s and A r. Based on an equivalent free field analogy, the distance dependence of these terms may moreover be expressed analytically. Secondly, an analytical expression is proposed to compute A s and A r for 3D configurations from using 2D configurations only. The expression includes dependence of the street width-to-height ratio, the difference in building heights and the percentage of fa{\c{c}}ade openings in the horizontal plane. For the expression to be valid, the source should be separated from the receiver environment by at least four times the street width.},

For this purpose, its sound source model overcomes the limitations of conventional models as it predicts airframe and engine noise separately in dependency of the flight parameters like power setting, Mach number and flight configuration. The acoustical description is decoupled from the propagation and based on spectral and directional source power distribution levels, which allow predicting realistic spectra at the source but also at the receiver. This paper provides an overview of the sound source model and studies the effects of the model parameters on the sound emission. Flight conditions for typical flight phases of approach and departure are depicted at the emission as well as at the receiver side and compared to measurements. In addition, different reduced model approaches are compared with the full model approach to show the importance of lateral directivity and flight parameters.},
